Statement of Purpose
To Immigration New Zealand,
My name is Zay Yar Min, a Myanmar citizen currently residing in Singapore. I am applying for a Partner of Student Work Visa to accompany and support my spouse while she undertakes her studies in New Zealand.
Purpose of Visit
My primary intention in applying for this visa is to live together with my spouse and our two daughters during the period of her studies in New Zealand. Our daughters, born in 2016 and 2019, are very close to their mother, who has been their main caregiver since birth. Since my wife will be focusing on her studies while also caring for them, it is essential for me to be present to support her and take responsibility for our children’s wellbeing.
We share a strong and committed relationship, and it is important for us to remain together as a family, supporting one another through this stage of her academic journey.
In addition, I wish to contribute meaningfully during my stay by working legally within the conditions of my visa. With more than 14 years of professional experience in software engineering and technology leadership, I am confident in my ability to find suitable temporary employment that can help support our living expenses. Nevertheless, my foremost priority is to accompany my spouse and provide the emotional, practical, and parental support our family needs while she pursues her studies.
Genuine and Temporary Intentions
I fully understand that this visa is temporary and is tied to my spouse’s study program. I have no intention of overstaying beyond the visa validity or breaching immigration laws. My long-term home remains in Singapore/Myanmar, where I have strong family and professional ties.
I have a well-established career in Singapore, where I currently work as a Senior Software Development Manager. I have been entrusted with leading teams and managing critical software projects, which demonstrates my professional stability and strong prospects outside New Zealand. I also maintain family connections and commitments in my home country, which are additional reasons for my eventual return.
Financial and Work Capacity
As a family, we have secured sufficient funds to comfortably cover travel and living expenses in New Zealand. Our joint savings amount to over SGD 140,000 (approximately NZD 185,000), accumulated primarily from my salary as a Senior Software Development Manager in Singapore since 2010.
I have provided official bank statements, account holder confirmation, payslips, and tax records as proof of consistent income and savings. My wife also maintains personal savings, which further strengthens our financial capacity.
This demonstrates that we are financially well-prepared to support ourselves during our temporary stay in New Zealand while fully complying with all visa conditions.
Compliance with Visa Conditions
I acknowledge and will adhere to all conditions of this visa:
I will work only in accordance with the visa permissions.
I will reside lawfully in New Zealand for the duration of the visa.
I will leave New Zealand once my spouse’s study program is completed and our visas expire.
Travel History and Good Character
I have previously traveled internationally for both professional and personal reasons and have always complied with immigration requirements of the countries I visited. I have never overstayed or breached visa conditions. I also confirm that I have never been involved in any unlawful or criminal activity.
Conclusion
In summary, my purpose is genuine and temporary: to accompany my spouse during her studies in New Zealand, to support her emotionally and financially, and to experience New Zealand as a lawful visitor. I have strong professional and family ties outside New Zealand, which ensure my return once her studies are completed.
I respectfully request Immigration New Zealand to consider my application favorably.
Sincerely,
 Zay Yar Min
