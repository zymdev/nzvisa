**Subject:** Explanation for household registration - May La Min Dependent Child Student Visa

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing on behalf of my daughter May La Min to explain that we do not possess a household registration document as required for her dependent child student visa application.

May La Min was born in Singapore in 2016 and has lived continuously with my wife and me at our family residence. As we are Myanmar citizens residing in Singapore, and our family has resided exclusively in Singapore since our marriage in 2015, no household registration was issued in Myanmar for our children.

To provide evidence of May La Min's residence with our family, I have included her birth certificate which shows our family address at 63 Tampines Avenue 1 at the time of her birth in 2016, utility bills demonstrating our continued family residence at 139 Pasir Ris Street 11 since 2017, and joint bank account statements showing May La Min's name and our current address.

As May La Min is a dependent child traveling with both parents to New Zealand for her mother's studies, these documents should adequately demonstrate our family unit and her dependency status.

Thank you for your consideration.

**Yours sincerely,**

**Zay Yar Min**
