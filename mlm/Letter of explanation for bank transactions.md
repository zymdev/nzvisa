**Subject:** Letter of Explanation for Bank Transactions - May La Min Dependent Child Student Visa

---

Dear Sir / Madam,

I am writing on behalf of my daughter May La Min to clarify the withdrawals and deposits reflected in the bank statement I submitted in support of her dependent child student visa application for New Zealand.

This account is my joint savings account with my wife, which we use for daily expenses, including our children's school fees, insurance premiums, and utility bills.

## Transaction Explanations

**Cash deposit in March 2025:** After my wife's return from Myanmar on 26 February 2025, her mother-in-law and parents gave her approximately SGD 15,000 in cash to cover flight and hotel bookings, as well as travel expenses for their visits to Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam in March–April 2025. On 1 March 2025, she deposited this amount in two transactions of SGD 7,500 each due to the ATM limit.

**Hotel and flight bookings:** Transactions labeled "AGODA.COM ORCHARD HO INTERNET HK" refer to hotel bookings at Orchard Hotel Singapore for her parents and their siblings during their visit.

**Cash withdrawals:** On 26 March 2025, my wife withdrew SGD 1,500 and SGD 400 for her mother-in-law; on 9 April 2025, she withdrew SGD 1,000 and SGD 500 for her parents' expenses. Because of these travel-related expenses, our spending in March and April 2025 was unusually high.

**Savings transfer:** On 1 July 2025, I transferred SGD 10,000 from my personal account into the joint account as part of our regular savings routine, unrelated to the March–April travel expenses.

**Monthly bonus interest:** Interest is received each month between the 2nd and 5th, depending on our spending.

I confirm that all transactions in the submitted bank statements are legitimate and reflect family and household expenses. I have attached all supporting documents for these transactions. I believe this explanation clarifies the nature and purpose of the transactions.

## Documents Attached
1. **Hotel and flight booking confirmations** (Agoda.com accommodations and VietJet Air tickets)
2. **Credit card statements** showing additional travel-related transactions
3. **Bank transfer receipt** showing SGD 10,000 transfer from personal account to joint account (01 July 2025)
4. **Family visit photographs** taken during the March-April 2025 visits

*Note: UOB joint bank statements (6 months) have been uploaded separately under the main financial documents section.*

Yours sincerely,

**Zay Yar Min**
