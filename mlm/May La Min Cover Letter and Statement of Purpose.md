**Subject:** Cover Letter - May La Min Dependent Child Student Visa Application

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing on behalf of my daughter May La Min to support her application for a dependent child student visa to accompany her mother, Khin Khaing Zar Thein, who will be pursuing a Master of Information Technology at the University of Waikato.

**About May La Min**

May La Min is 9 years old, born on 27 May 2016 in Singapore. She is a Myanmar citizen and has lived with our family in Singapore since birth. She is currently attending Primary 3 and has never been separated from either parent for extended periods.

**Application Summary**

As our family believes in staying together, May La Min requires a dependent child student visa to accompany her mother during her academic studies in New Zealand. She will attend local primary school in Hamilton while maintaining the family support system essential for her development.

**Documents Provided**

I have submitted the following documents in support of May La Min's application:

- Evidence of funds demonstrating sufficient financial capacity
- Letter of explanation for bank transactions
- Explanation for household registration
- Birth certificate and family documentation

As her father and financial guarantor, I will provide full financial support for May La Min's living expenses, education costs, and healthcare needs during our family's stay in New Zealand.

Thank you for your consideration of May La Min's dependent child student visa application.

**Yours sincerely,**

**Zay Yar Min**  
*(Father and Financial Guarantor)*
