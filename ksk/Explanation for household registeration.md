**Subject:** Explanation for household registration - Kyal Sin Khaing Dependent Child Student Visa

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing on behalf of my daughter Kyal Sin Khaing to explain that we do not possess a household registration document as required for her dependent child student visa application.

Kyal Sin Khaing was born in Singapore in 2019 and has lived continuously with my wife and me at our family residence. As we are Myanmar citizens residing in Singapore, and our family has resided exclusively in Singapore since our marriage in 2015, no household registration was issued in Myanmar for our children.

To provide evidence of Kyal Sin Khaing's residence with our family, I have included her birth certificate which shows our family address at 139 Pasir Ris Street 11 at the time of her birth in 2019, utility bills demonstrating our continued family residence at this address, and joint bank account statements showing Kyal Sin Khaing's name and our current address.

As Kyal Sin Khaing is a dependent child traveling with both parents to New Zealand for her mother's studies, these documents should adequately demonstrate our family unit and her dependency status.

Thank you for your consideration.

**Yours sincerely,**

**Zay Yar Min**
