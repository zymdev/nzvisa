**Subject:** Cover Letter - Kyal Sin Khaing Dependent Child Student Visa Application

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing on behalf of my daughter Kyal Sin Khaing to support her application for a dependent child student visa to accompany her mother, Khin Khaing Zar Thein, who will be pursuing a Master of Information Technology at the University of Waikato.

**About Kyal Sin Khaing**

Kyal Sin Khaing is 6 years old, born on 8 August 2019 in Singapore. She is a Myanmar citizen and has lived with our family in Singapore since birth. She is currently attending kindergarten and has never been separated from either parent for extended periods.

**Application Summary**

As our family believes in staying together, Kyal Sin Khaing requires a dependent child student visa to accompany her mother during her academic studies in New Zealand. She will attend local kindergarten or primary school in Hamilton while maintaining the family support system essential for her development.

**Documents Provided**

I have submitted the following documents in support of Kyal Sin Khaing's application:

- Evidence of funds demonstrating sufficient financial capacity
- Letter of explanation for bank transactions
- Explanation for household registration
- Birth certificate, Singapore dependant pass, and immunisation history
- Certificate letter from Newlife preschool, Singapore

As her father and financial guarantor, I will provide full financial support for Kyal Sin Khaing's living expenses, education costs, and healthcare needs during our family's stay in New Zealand.

Thank you for your consideration of Kyal Sin Khaing's dependent child student visa application.

**Yours sincerely,**

**Zay Yar Min**
