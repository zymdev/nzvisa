**Subject:** Evidence of funds to support my daughter Kyal Sin Khaing in New Zealand

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to provide evidence on behalf of my daughter Kyal Sin Khaing that we have sufficient funds to support her dependent child student visa application. As her father and financial guarantor, I have been employed full-time in Singapore for 15 years since 2010, and my current role is Senior Software Development Manager. My daughter's application is for a dependent child student visa to accompany her mother, Khin Khaing Zar Thein, who is pursuing a Master of Information Technology at the University of Waikato.

My financial capacity is demonstrated through readily available savings held in our joint UOB bank account, exceeding SGD 140,000 (approximately NZD 185,000). These funds, which are sourced from my employment income with a gross monthly salary of SGD 7,885 (excluding bonuses), are more than sufficient to cover my daughter's living costs, education expenses, and any contingencies during our family's stay in New Zealand.

To evidence these funds and their source, I have attached the following documents:

### Documents Attached
1. **Six months of joint UOB bank statements**
2. **My Certificate of Employment, six months of payslips, and one year's tax documents**

For a detailed explanation of specific transactions, such as larger cash deposits and withdrawals in Marchâ€“April 2025, I have uploaded a separate document under "Other financial information" titled "Letter of explanation for bank transactions.pdf".

I trust this information clearly demonstrates my ability to support my daughter Kyal Sin Khaing during her stay in New Zealand as a dependent child. Thank you for your consideration of her visa application.


Yours sincerely,

**Zay Yar Min**
