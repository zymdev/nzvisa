**Subject:** Evidence that our relationship is genuine and stable

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to provide evidence that my relationship with my wife, Khin Khaing Zar Thein, is genuine and stable as required for my Partner of a Student Work Visa application.

Both my wife and I are originally from Taunggyi, Myanmar. We first met in Yangon in May 2008 through mutual friends. In 2010, I moved to Singapore for work, and although we lived apart during that period, we maintained a close relationship through regular communication and my visits back to Myanmar.

In 2015, my wife moved to Singapore, and we were married on 3 April 2015. Since then, we have been living together continuously in Singapore. We have built a strong and stable family life, and we are blessed with two children, born in 2016 and 2019, both in Singapore.

## Financial partnership

We maintain a joint UOB bank account in Singapore where we manage all our household expenses and savings together. All financial decisions are made jointly, and we share responsibility for our family's financial well-being.

## Family support and recognition

Our families in Taunggyi, Myanmar fully recognize and support our marriage. Both of our parents are close to each other and maintain regular contact. They continue to be actively involved in our lives and our children's upbringing through regular communication and visits.

My first cousin Pyay Mon Kyaw, who lives in New Zealand, and my friend Nyein Chan Swe have provided supporting letters confirming our relationship and family commitment.

## Long-term planning and assets

As part of our long-term planning for our family's future, my wife owns 3 plots of land in Myanmar and I own 2 plots of land in Myanmar. These individual investments represent our joint commitment to building a secure future for our family. I will include plot images as evidence of these assets.

## Stability and commitment

Our relationship has been stable and exclusive for over 16 years since we first met. We have never been separated except for the brief period before our marriage when I was establishing myself in Singapore. We maintain regular communication with both families and have built a stable life together in Singapore.

## Supporting documents provided

1. **Marriage certificate** (Singapore, April 2015)
2. **Birth certificates** of our two children
3. **Joint UOB bank account statements**
4. **Supporting letters** from family members and friends:
   - Pyay Mon Kyaw (my first cousin, confirming our relationship)
   - Nyein Chan Swe (my friend, confirming our family commitment)
5. **Family photographs** taken over the years
6. **Land ownership documents** with plot images:
   - My wife's 3 plots in Myanmar

I trust this evidence clearly demonstrates the authenticity and stability of our marriage.
