My family has resided in Singapore for 10 years. My husband holds a Singapore Employment Pass and works as Senior Software Development Manager at NETe2 Asia since 2010. Our daughters were born in Singapore and hold Student Passes for their primary education. They are in Primary 3 and Primary 1, with my elder daughter's PSLE examination in 2028.

**Q3: Please provide details**

I hold a BSc in Mathematics, Diploma in Computer Science, and Master of Information Science (2009). I taught computer courses at Myan Yu Computer Training in Myanmar, worked at Ye Yint Pte Ltd in Singapore, and volunteer at Dr Htar Healthcare. My 2009 Master's focused on theoretical foundations but lacks modern specializations: cloud computing, cybersecurity, data analytics, and AI/machine learning. The Master of Information Technology provides these competencies plus a 400-hour internship.

**Q4: Why do you want to come to New Zealand to study?**

New Zealand offers high-quality education with a practical approach. The Master of Information Technology provides modern specializations my 2009 degree lacks - cloud computing, cybersecurity, data analytics, and AI. The 400-hour internship gives real-world experience. The 12-month program lets me minimize time away from my family in Singapore while gaining internationally recognized qualifications.

**Q5: Why have you chosen this education provider?**

The University of Waikato combines advanced coursework in cloud systems, cybersecurity, data analytics, and AI with a mandatory 400-hour supervised internship. The 12-month timeline lets me return to Singapore quickly to support my children's education. The university has QS World Rankings recognition and strong industry connections. This structure helps me gain modern IT competencies efficiently while minimizing family separation.

**Q6: How will studying this course benefit you?**

This program provides modern competencies my 2009 Master's lacks: cloud computing, cybersecurity, data analytics, and AI. The 400-hour internship gives practical experience. Singapore IT professionals with these skills earn SGD 5,000-9,000 monthly for roles like Application Developer, Cloud Engineer, and Cyber Security Analyst. This qualification lets me pursue IT careers in Singapore where my family lives, while supporting my children's education including my elder daughter's PSLE in 2028.

**Q7: What are you planning to do when you finish this study?**

I will return to Singapore in February 2027 to support my elder daughter's PSLE preparation in 2028 and my younger daughter in Primary 2, and reunite with my husband who continues working at NETe2 Asia. I will pursue IT positions such as Application Developer, Cloud Engineer, or Cyber Security Analyst. As Myanmar citizens, we maintain connections to Myanmar through property ownership and family, representing potential long-term plans after our children finish their education in Singapore.
