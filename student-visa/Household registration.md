**To:** Visa Officer, New Zealand Immigration  
**Subject:** Explanation for Household Registration  

Dear Sir/Madam,

I do not possess a household registration document from Myanmar. My husband and I were married in Singapore on 3 April 2015, and both our daughters, May La Min (born 26 May 2016) and Kyal Sin Khaing (born 1 September 2019), were born in Singapore. As our family has been residing in Singapore since our marriage, we do not have a household registration in Myanmar.

## FAMILY RESIDENCE HISTORY IN SINGAPORE

Our family has resided continuously in Singapore since our marriage:

**2015-2016:** 2A Cambridge Village, Cambridge Road, #04-07, Singapore 219679

**2016-2017:** 63 Tampines Avenue 1, #15-05, Singapore 529777

**2017-Present (8 years):** 139 Pasir Ris Street 11, #07-195, Singapore 510139

We are registered as authorized tenants with the Singapore Housing Development Board (HDB) for our current address. All four family members are officially listed as residents in the HDB system, serving the equivalent function of household registration.

## SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS ATTACHED

1. **Marriage Certificate (3 April 2015)** - legal marriage in Singapore
2. **May La Min's Birth Certificate (26 May 2016)** - birth in Singapore, family relationship
3. **Kyal Sin Khaing's Birth Certificate (1 September 2019)** - birth in Singapore, current address
4. **HDB Tenant List** - all four family members registered at current address
5. **Tenancy Agreement** - legal residence at current address

These documents provide evidence of our family's continuous cohabitation in Singapore since 2015. I respectfully request they be accepted in place of a Myanmar household registration document.
