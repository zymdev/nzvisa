To Visa Officer, New Zealand Immigration
Subject: Study Visa Application - Statement of Purpose
Dear Sir / Madam,
I am writing to support my application for a study visa to pursue the Master of Information Technology at University of Waikato. My name is Khin Khaing Zar Thein, a Myanmar national with a strong academic foundation in information technology. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, a Diploma in Computer Science, and a Master of Information Science, which demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth. I am confident that the MInfoTech program at the University of Waikato will provide me with advanced knowledge, practical skills, and valuable industry exposure. These experiences will enable me to re-establish my IT training career in Myanmar and collaborate effectively with my husband on future software development projects.
Academic Background
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Taunggyi University, Myanmar (2002–2005), which built a solid foundation in logical thinking, quantitative reasoning, and structured problem-solving. To complement this, I earned a Diploma in Computer Science from the University of Computer Studies, Mandalay (2005–2006), where I gained practical knowledge of programming, system design, and applied computing.
Building on this foundation, I completed a Master of Information Science at the University of Computer Studies, Mandalay (2007–2009). Through this program, I developed advanced expertise in database management, software engineering, and artificial intelligence, along with practical skills in object-oriented programming and design. These studies enhanced my ability to analyze complex problems, design efficient algorithms, and implement reliable software solutions, which have been instrumental in my professional career.
Professional Background
I began my career in 2010 as an IT Trainer at Myan Yu Computer Training, Taunggyi, Myanmar, where I taught basic IT applications and computer fundamentals to small community groups and private learners. This role gave me the opportunity to design training materials, mentor students, and contribute to strengthening IT literacy within my community. It laid the foundation for my long-term commitment to technology education and community service.
In 2015, I relocated to Singapore and joined Ye Yint Pte. Ltd as an Administrative Executive (2015–2016). This experience enhanced my organizational, communication, and cross-functional collaboration skills while providing valuable exposure to a professional international work environment.
Since September 2021, I have been serving as a Program Manager (Volunteer) with Dr Htar Healthcare and Wellness Pte. Ltd., Singapore. Although I could not pursue a full-time salaried role due to family responsibilities caring for my two young children, I remained motivated to contribute to the organization’s mission of promoting affordable, healthy lifestyles among Myanmar citizens. In this capacity, I supported program coordination, managed social media content, and engaged with the community. This role also inspired me to adopt healthier lifestyle practices personally. My voluntary service reflects not only my commitment to meaningful work that benefits society but also my ability to balance professional contributions with personal responsibilities.
Reason for Choosing Master of Information Technology
My academic foundation was built through qualifications in mathematics and computer science, followed by a Master of Information Science in Myanmar. However, Myanmar’s education system has limited international recognition, and I recognize the need to update my knowledge to align with global standards. I began my career as an IT Trainer in Myanmar and later gained experience in Singapore in administrative and volunteer roles, which allowed me to apply IT skills in different professional settings. After relocating to Singapore following my marriage, I devoted my time to raising my two children, born in 2016 and 2019, which temporarily limited my ability to work as an IT professional full-time.
These experiences, though outside full-time IT practice, reinforced my understanding of the transformative power of technology and the need to update my expertise to meet modern industry standards. By pursuing the Master of Information Technology at the University of Waikato, I will gain advanced technical skills, global perspectives, and practical knowledge that will enable me to modernize IT training programs in Myanmar, and collaborate effectively with my husband on future software development projects. I view this program as a crucial step in resuming and advancing my career in IT, while also contributing meaningfully to both business growth and community development.
Why New Zealand
I chose New Zealand for its high-quality, internationally recognized education, which emphasizes a hands-on, practical, and research-focused approach. The academic environment is also known for being supportive and less stressful, allowing students to fully engage with advanced IT concepts and apply them effectively. In contrast, while Singapore’s universities are highly ranked, they are known for a rigorous, high-pressure environment that focuses heavily on engineering, programming, and technical theory.
I also value New Zealand’s unique culture and cool climate, which is similar to my hometown of Taunggyi, Shan State, Myanmar. As someone who enjoys traveling and exploring cultures, a passion reflected in my well-stamped passport, I look forward to engaging with New Zealand’s multicultural society and developing international connections that will support my academic and professional growth. Additionally, having
close friends and my husband’s first cousin, Pyay Mon Kyaw, in New Zealand, who has provided a supporting letter included in the relationship evidence, will help me settle in and adapt comfortably during my studies.
Why the University of Waikato
I chose the University of Waikato for its 180-point Master of Information Technology program, which combines advanced coursework with a structured 400-hour credit-bearing internship supervised by industry mentors and academic staff. This unique feature provides the practical, hands-on experience I need to update my professional skills and regain confidence after my career break. Waikato offers internationally recognized qualifications in a supportive learning environment, and its location in Hamilton is advantageous as my husband’s cousin and close friend live nearby. The program’s balance of academic rigor, industry-focused learning, and international exposure directly aligns with my long-term goals of modernizing IT training in Myanmar, and collaborating on software development projects.
Post-Study Plan
After completing the Master of Information Technology, I am fully committed to returning to Myanmar to support my family and contribute to the country’s IT development. My parents and most of my siblings remain in Myanmar, and as my parents grow older, I feel a strong responsibility to care for them while resuming and expanding my professional contributions in IT.
I plan to continue and enhance IT training programs at Myan Yu Computer Training in Taunggyi, providing practical, industry-relevant education and mentorship that prepares learners for careers in Myanmar’s growing digital economy. In parallel, I will collaborate with my husband on software development projects, applying the advanced skills, strategic knowledge, and practical experience gained through the Master of Information Technology program.
In addition, I own three plots of land in Myanmar, and my husband owns two plots, as documented in the evidence of family and financial commitments. These tangible assets, together with my family responsibilities and professional commitments, firmly anchor me to Myanmar. By combining my enhanced IT expertise with my established personal and professional ties, I am committed to returning home and making a meaningful contribution to Myanmar’s digital growth and community development.
Financial Arrangements
My husband, Zay Yar Min, is my financial guarantor for my studies in New Zealand. He has secured funds of over SGD 140,000 (equivalent to NZD 185,000) to fully cover my tuition fees, travel, and living expenses. These funds are held in our joint savings account, for which he is primarily responsible to ensure that sufficient balances are maintained.
He is currently employed in Singapore as a Senior Software Development Manager with over 14 years of professional experience. The joint account forms part of our long-term
family financial plan and is regularly supported through his income to ensure continued stability.
To demonstrate a reliable and sustainable source of funding, I have provided bank-issued confirmation of account ownership, bank statements, as well as my husband’s payslips and tax records, as detailed in his evidence of employment and income letter. This ensures I can meet all educational and living costs in New Zealand without financial difficulty. In addition, the joint nature of the account reflects our ongoing family financial responsibilities and long-term ties to Myanmar, reinforcing my commitment to return home and contribute to my family and community after completing my studies.
Conclusion
To summarize, I am committed to being a responsible and diligent student if given the opportunity to pursue the Master of Information Technology at the University of Waikato. I declare that the information provided in this application is accurate, truthful, and supported by relevant documents. I fully understand the rules and regulations of New Zealand immigration and will comply with all visa conditions, including academic progress, lawful conduct, and reporting requirements.
I am committed to utilizing this opportunity wisely, gaining advanced IT expertise, and applying it to modernize IT training programs, support my family’s businesses, and contribute to Myanmar’s digital development. My strong family responsibilities, professional experience, voluntary work, and property ownership firmly anchor my long-term commitment to returning home. I assure you that I will leave New Zealand before the end of my authorized stay.
I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration of my application and am available for any further clarifications via email or phone.
Yours sincerely,
