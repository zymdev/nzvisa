Subject: Support for Khin Khaing Zar Thein Application to Study in New Zealand

To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to express my full support for my sister-in-law, Khin Khaing Zar Thein, who is married to my cousin brother and is a devoted mother of two daughters. She is planning to pursue her Master of Information Technology in New Zealand. I am currently residing in New Zealand and am delighted to provide my backing for her academic and personal journey here.
I have known Khin Khaing Zar Thein, my sister-in law and her relationship with my cousin brother Zay Yar Min for many years. I can confidently attest to her dedication, strong character, and determination to achieve her educational goals. She has consistently demonstrated commitment to her studies and career development, and I believe that pursuing her Master of Information Technology in New Zealand will provide her with the knowledge and skills to contribute meaningfully to her field.
During her time in New Zealand, I will provide her with emotional and practical support to help her settle into the community and focus on her studies. I will be available to assist her in adapting to life here and ensure she has a stable and supportive environment as she completes her degree.
I believe Khin Khaing Zar Thein will be a positive addition to both the academic community and the wider New Zealand society. Her ambition and dedication will enable her to make the most of this opportunity, and I am proud to support her decision to continue her education in this country.
Thank you for considering her application. Please feel free to contact me should you require any further information or confirmation of my support.
Sincerely,
Pyay Mon Kyaw
