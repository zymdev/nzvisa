What are your family, financial, employment or other commitments in your home country?
My parents and most of my siblings live in Taunggyi, Myanmar, where I visit them regularly. I own three plots of land
there, and my husband owns two plots. These strong family ties and property holdings firmly anchor me to
Taunggyi, and I plan to return to support my family and continue my IT teaching career.
Does your planned study relate to your previous study or work?
Yes
Please provide details
Yes. I hold a BSc in Mathematics, a Diploma in Computer Science, and a Master of Information Science. I taught
basic computer courses at Myan Yu Computer Training in Myanmar, worked at Ye Yint Pte Ltd applying IT systems
to improve operations, and volunteered at Dr Htar Healthcare and Wellness supporting IT related initiatives.
Why do you want to come to New Zealand to study?
I chose New Zealand for its high quality education with a practical hands on approach. The academic pace allows me
to focus on deeply understanding and applying IT concepts. I value New Zealands culture and climate, which is
similar to my hometown of Taunggyi. I also look forward to engaging in its multicultural society and developing
international connections. Friends and my husbands cousin in New Zealand will help me settle comfortably.
Why have you chosen this education provider?
The University of Waikato Master of Information Technology program combines advanced coursework with a 400
hour supervised internship. It provides practical experience, recognized qualifications, and a supportive environment.
Its focus on applied learning and industry exposure aligns with my goals of modernizing IT training, and collaborating
on software development projects.
How will studying this course benefit you?
The Master of Information Technology will strengthen my skills in software design, cybersecurity, cloud systems, and
IT leadership. The internship provides practical experience, enabling me to confidently resume and expand IT
training in Myanmar, and collaborate on software development projects with my husband.
What are you planning to do when you finish this study?

Declaration
You have read and understood this Declaration, INZ's Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use for Immigration Online.
The information you provide must be true, correct and complete
You have provided true and correct answers to the questions in this form, and uploaded all the documents
requested, including any translations of documents that are required. The documents you have uploaded are
genuine, and they accurately reflect the answers you have given to the questions in this form.
You understand that you may be required to provide additional information, including attending a medical examination
and providing your passport to Immigration New Zealand (INZ), before your application is decided. If additional
information is requested and you do not provide it within the timeframes provided, your application may be declined.
Any additional information requested will form part of your application.
You will inform INZ of any relevant fact or change of circumstances that may affect the decision on your application
for a visa (including because you may no longer meet the criteria for the visa for which you are applying) or affect the
decision to grant entry permission based on the visa for which you are applying.
Examples of matters you should inform INZ about include a change in employment or partnership status, a change in
your health, or a new issue related to character requirements.
You understand that, by submitting this application, you are providing information to an immigration officer. If false or
misleading information is submitted or relevant information is withheld, including by your agent, your application may
be declined without further warning. You may be denied entry to New Zealand or made liable for deportation. If
your visa has already been approved it may be cancelled. It is an offence under the Immigration Act 2009 to provide
false or misleading information in relation to a visa application, and you may be prosecuted.
You must only receive immigration advice from a person who is licensed, or exempt from
licensing
You understand that if you have received immigration advice from any person, and that person is not licensed under
the Immigration Advisers Licensing Act 2007 when they should be, INZ will not continue to process your application.
For more information, see www.iaa.govt.nz
Collection and use of your information
Collection of your information is authorised by the Immigration Act 2009 and the Immigration (Visa, Entry Permission

may be delayed, or your application may be declined.
You understand that INZ is collecting and will use the information in this application, including any associated
documents, to:
assess your eligibility to apply for a visa, and
assess your visa application, and make decisions about entry to New Zealand, and
improve INZ’s services and its administration of the Immigration Act 2009, including internal quality assurance and

documents, and matters relating to your immigration status.
Your information may also be anonymised and used for survey or research purposes.

INZ shares information with agencies and organisations to confirm your immigration status

INZ will keep your information
You understand that when you submit this application, the information you provide will be retained in INZ records, in
accordance with INZ's retention policies.
You must comply with the conditions of your visa
If your visa application is approved, you understand that you must comply with all the conditions of that visa and
leave New Zealand on or before the expiry date of that visa. If you remain in New Zealand after your visa has
expired, you may be deported by INZ. If you are granted a limited visa and you remain in New Zealand after your visa
has expired, you may be deported by INZ without the right of appeal.
Student visa conditions include:
that you have the required funds for your stay;
that you have pre-paid flights or the ability to purchase outward travel; and
that you attend your course of study and make satisfactory progress in your study.
If the student is 9 years old or younger, they will be granted a student visa with the condition that they are
accompanied by a legal guardian, unless they are living in an approved school hostel. If their visa is granted with the
condition that they are accompanied by a legal guardian, you agree that they will live with their legal guardian. You
understand that both the student and the legal guardian could be made liable for deportation if this condition is not
met.
Access to health care while in New Zealand
You agree that if you are not entitled to publicly funded health care in New Zealand, you, or your sponsor, if
applicable, will pay for any health care or medical assistance you may require in New Zealand.

INZ will not use or disclose the information provided in this application for any other purpose unless such use or
disclosure is required or permitted by law.
Under the Privacy Act 2020 you have the right to request access to all information held about yourself and to
