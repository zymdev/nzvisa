Subject: Evidence of Family and Financial Commitments in Myanmar
Dear Sir / Madam,
I am writing this letter to provide supporting evidence of my family and financial commitments in Myanmar, as referenced in the “Your situation and plans” section of my application.
Family Commitments
I have strong and enduring family ties in Myanmar. My parents and most of my siblings live in Myanmar, and as they grow older, I have a responsibility to care for them. These commitments firmly anchor me to my home country and reinforce my intention to return after completing my studies.
To support this, I have included family photographs taken at our hometown house in Taunggyi, showing my parents, siblings, and children together. These photographs reflect the close family relationships and responsibilities that connect me to Myanmar.
Property and Financial Assets
In addition to my family responsibilities, I also have substantial financial commitments in Myanmar. I own three plots of land, and my husband owns two plots. These tangible assets demonstrate our long-term investment in Myanmar and further reinforce our permanent ties.
To support this, I have included property ownership documents for the land registered under my name and my husband’s name.
Together, my family responsibilities, long-term property ownership, and professional commitments provide clear evidence of my strong and permanent ties to Myanmar. These circumstances demonstrate that I am firmly anchored to my home country and committed to returning after completing my studies.

Yours sincerely,
Khin Khaing Zar Thein
