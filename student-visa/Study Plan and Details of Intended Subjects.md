## Programme Overview

The Master of Information Technology is a 180-point programme combining advanced technical coursework and a 60-point credit-bearing industry internship. This programme updates my 16-year-old IT qualifications with current industry skills (cloud computing, cybersecurity, modern development practices) and provides the 400-hour supervised internship essential for career re-entry after my career break (2016-2021).

The February 2026 intake allows me to complete the full programme in 12 months and return to Singapore in February 2027 to rejoin my family and pursue professional IT positions (Application Developer, Cloud Engineer, Cyber Security Analyst) at Singapore companies.

## Trimester A – Foundation & Applied Skills (60 points)

## Trimester C – Industry Application (60 points)

**CSMAX596 Computer Science Internship (Core, 60 points)**  
400-hour supervised industry internship providing hands-on professional IT workplace experience. This component is critical for my career re-entry after my career break (2016-2021) and volunteer-only work since 2021.

The supervised internship provides:
- Verifiable professional IT work experience to address the employment gap in my resume
- Practical application of cloud computing, cybersecurity, and software development skills in real business contexts
- Industry references from workplace supervisors
- Portfolio-quality project evidence for Singapore job applications
- Professional confidence building after extended career break

Singapore employers prioritize candidates with current industry experience. This 400-hour internship directly addresses the barrier to securing paid IT employment after my career break.

## Conclusion

This programme provides:

1. **Updated Technical Skills:** Cloud computing (COMPX527), cybersecurity (COMPX511, COMPX515), and modern programming (COMPX575, COMPX576) address the 16-year gap between my 2009 theoretical computer science education and current industry requirements.

2. **Career Re-Entry Support:** The 400-hour supervised internship (CSMAX596) and professional preparation (CSMAX570) provide the structured workplace experience necessary to re-enter paid IT employment after my career break.

3. **Singapore Employment Alignment:** Courses directly support my target positions - Application Developer (SGD 5,000-7,000), Cloud Engineer (SGD 6,000-9,000), Software Engineer (SGD 4,500-6,500), and Cyber Security Analyst (SGD 5,500-8,000) at Singapore companies.

Upon completing this programme in February 2027, I will return to Singapore with current industry-relevant qualifications, verified professional workplace experience, and the credentials necessary to pursue paid IT positions while supporting my daughters through their primary school years in Singapore.
