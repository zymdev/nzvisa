Subject: Explanation for household registration
Dear Sir / Madam,
I would like to explain that I do not possess a household registration document. My husband and I were married in Singapore in 2015, and both of our children were born here. Consequently, no household registration was issued in Myanmar.
To provide alternative evidence of our family residence and cohabitation, please note the following:
We were married in 2015, and our address at that time was 2A Cambridge Village, Cambridge Road, #04-07, Singapore 219679, as indicated in our marriage certificate.


In 2016, we moved to 63 Tampines Avenue 1, #15-05, Singapore 529777, where we resided together with our elder daughter at the time of her birth, as documented in her birth certificate.


In 2017, we moved to our current address: 139 Pasir Ris Street 11, #07-195, Singapore 510139. To demonstrate that we have been residing at this address since 2017, I have provided utility bills showing our names and address.


Additionally, we have included the current tenant list from the Singapore Housing Development Board, confirming that we are presently living together as a family.


These documents collectively provide clear evidence of our family’s continuous residence together in Singapore. I respectfully request that they be accepted in place of a household registration.
Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Khin Khaing Zar Thein
