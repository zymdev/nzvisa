Reason for choosing Master of Information Technology:  
My passion for information technology began during my five years as a Training Program Manager at Myan Yu Computer Training, where I managed and delivered IT training programs that empowered students with professional skills. Following my marriage, I relocated to Singapore to be with my husband. While I initially intended to pursue a Master’s degree there, I devoted my time to raising my two children, born in 2016 and 2019. During this period, I worked as an Administrative Executive at GYI Pte. Ltd., where I applied IT systems to streamline operations and enhance productivity—an experience that reaffirmed my belief in the transformative impact of technology.
Now that my children are older, I am committed to advancing my career. I have chosen the Master of Information Technology at the University of Waikato to strengthen my expertise in software design, enterprise systems, and strategic IT leadership. This qualification will prepare me to take on senior roles in the technology industry, lead innovative solutions, and contribute meaningfully to the digital transformation of businesses.
Career Goals: 
My immediate goal after completing the Master of Information Technology is to join a multinational company in Singapore in a challenging role that enables me to gain valuable industry experience. Working in Singapore’s dynamic and diverse tech environment will help me strengthen my technical expertise, expand my professional network, and develop leadership capabilities essential for career advancement.
In the long term, I aim to leverage this experience to establish a software development company in Singapore with my husband, who is currently a Senior Software Development Manager. This path reflects my strong commitment to building a future with my family in Singapore while contributing meaningfully to the growth of the regional technology sector.
Reasons for Choosing New Zealand:  
I chose New Zealand as my study destination for several key reasons. Firstly, it is renowned for its high-quality education system and well-ranked universities, offering an excellent environment to pursue a Master of Information Technology. The practical, industry-focused approach to learning aligns perfectly with my goal of acquiring globally valued skills.
New Zealand’s reputation for safety, hospitality, and cultural diversity makes it an ideal place for international students. As someone who loves travelling and exploring new cultures, as reflected by my well-stamped passport, I value the opportunity to immerse myself in a vibrant, multicultural society while building international connections.
Beyond academics, New Zealand’s stunning landscapes and pleasant climate offer an inspiring setting that balances study with personal well-being. This combination of world-class education, cultural richness, and a welcoming environment makes New Zealand the perfect choice for my further studies.
Financial Arrangements: 
I have secured sufficient funds to cover the full tuition fee of NZ$72,408.00 and all living expenses for the duration of my Master of Information Technology program in New Zealand. My husband, a Senior Software Development Manager in Singapore, will be my financial sponsor throughout my studies.
To demonstrate this, I have provided bank statements, payslips, and tax documents as evidence of our financial capacity. These documents show that we meet and exceed New Zealand Immigration’s requirements for living costs and tuition fees. This ensures I can fully support my education, accommodation, and daily expenses without financial difficulty during my stay.
Study Plan:
The program is scheduled to commence in February 2026, with an anticipated duration of 18 months. During this Master of Information Technology program, I will focus on developing advanced technical skills in software development, business intelligence, and IT strategies. These competencies are essential to advancing my career and enabling me to contribute effectively to the technology sector.
After Study Plan:
Upon completing my Master of Information Technology, I intend to return to Singapore to continue my professional career as an IT specialist. Working in Singapore will allow me to strengthen my family’s financial stability by contributing alongside my husband, who is currently a Senior Software Development Manager.
My children were born and raised in Singapore, and their identity and upbringing are deeply rooted in the country. They are currently attending primary school, benefiting from Singapore’s high standard of education. Staying in Singapore ensures continuity in their schooling and social environment, which is essential for their development.
Furthermore, my husband’s established career and our family life are based in Singapore, making it the natural place for us to settle and grow both professionally and personally. I am fully committed to returning to Singapore after my studies, where I have strong family ties and professional opportunities.
I understand the importance of complying with New Zealand immigration requirements and am fully committed to leaving New Zealand upon completion of my study programme. I will provide evidence that I have secured sufficient funds to cover my return travel ticket and living expenses.
Comply with the Laws of New Zealand Government: 
I confirm my comprehensive understanding of rules and regulations of the New Zealand Government.
I am aware that a student visa allows temporary residence for studying at an approved educational institution, without providing permanent residency or citizenship rights.
I acknowledge the requirements of having an offer of enrollment, meeting financial obligations, and fulfilling health and character criteria.
I understand that the visa duration depends on the approved course length and that international students have specific work rights.
I recognize the importance of compliance with New Zealand's laws, including academic progress, attendance, and updating contact information.

With this understanding, I am committed to accepting these rules and regulations while pursuing my educational goals in New Zealand.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, my primary objective in pursuing a Master of Information Technology is to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to advance my career. I aim to gain updated expertise in software and IT strategies that will enable me to contribute meaningfully across industries.
I have no criminal record in any country and assure that I will maintain exemplary conduct throughout my studies. I appreciate your time in reviewing my application and look forward to your positive consideration.
Thank you very much for your time and attention.
Yours sincerely,
Khin Khaing Zar Thein
