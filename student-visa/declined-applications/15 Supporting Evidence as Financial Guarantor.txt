Subject: Supporting Evidence as Financial Guarantor for My Wife’s Study Visa Application
Dear Sir / Madam,
I am writing to provide evidence of the relationship between my wife, Khin Khaing Zar
Thein, and myself, Zay Yar Min, in support of her New Zealand student visa application. I
am also her financial guarantor for the duration of her studies in New Zealand.
Relationship and Family History
I am married to Khin Khaing Zar Thein, as documented in our marriage certificate. We have
two children, May La Min (born 2016) and Kyal Sin Khaing (born 2019), with birth certificates
provided. These documents confirm the genuine and stable nature of our family relationship.
Cohabitation Evidence
We have lived together continuously in Singapore since our marriage. Evidence of our
cohabitation is provided as follows:
● 2015–2016: 2A Cambridge Village, Cambridge Road, #04-07, Singapore 219679 (as
shown in our marriage certificate)
● 2016–2017: 63 Tampines Avenue 1, #15-05, Singapore 529777 (as shown in the birth
certificate of our eldest daughter)
● 2017–Present: 139 Pasir Ris Street 11, #07-195, Singapore 510139 (supported by a

Financial Capacity
I am employed in Singapore as a Senior Software Development Manager, with a monthly
salary of SGD 7,885, which is the primary source of household income. I am fully responsible
for financially supporting my wife during her studies in New Zealand, including tuition,
accommodation, and living expenses. Our joint savings exceed SGD 140,000 (approximately
NZD 185,000). Supporting documents include bank statements, payslips, tax records, and
account holder confirmation.
These documents collectively demonstrate the authenticity and stability of our marital
relationship, our continuous cohabitation, and my financial capacity to support my wife during
her studies in New Zealand.
Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Zay Yar Min
Senior Software Development Manager
