What are your family, financial, employment or other commitments in your home country?
My parents and most of my siblings live in Taunggyi, Myanmar, where I visit them regularly. I own three plots of land
there, and my husband owns two plots. These strong family ties and property holdings firmly anchor me to
Taunggyi, and I plan to return to support my family and continue my IT teaching career.

Does your planned study relate to your previous study or work?
Yes

Please provide details
Yes. I hold a BSc in Mathematics, a Diploma in Computer Science, and a Master of Information Science. I taught
basic computer courses at Myan Yu Computer Training in Myanmar, worked at Ye Yint Pte Ltd applying IT systems
to improve operations, and volunteered at Dr Htar Healthcare and Wellness supporting IT related initiatives.

Why do you want to come to New Zealand to study?
I chose New Zealand for its high quality education with a practical hands on approach. The academic pace allows me
to focus on deeply understanding and applying IT concepts. I value New Zealands culture and climate, which is
similar to my hometown of Taunggyi. I also look forward to engaging in its multicultural society and developing
international connections. Friends and my husbands cousin in New Zealand will help me settle comfortably.

Why have you chosen this education provider?
The University of Waikato Master of Information Technology program combines advanced coursework with a 400
hour supervised internship. It provides practical experience, recognized qualifications, and a supportive environment.
Its focus on applied learning and industry exposure aligns with my goals of modernizing IT training, and collaborating
on software development projects.

How will studying this course benefit you?
The Master of Information Technology will strengthen my skills in software design, cybersecurity, cloud systems, and
IT leadership. The internship provides practical experience, enabling me to confidently resume and expand IT
training in Myanmar, and collaborate on software development projects with my husband.

What are you planning to do when you finish this study?
I am committed to returning to Myanmar to care for my parents, continue IT training programs that provide practical
education and mentorship, and collaborate with my husband on software projects to contribute to Myanmar IT
sector.
