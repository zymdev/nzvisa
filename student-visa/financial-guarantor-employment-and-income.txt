To Visa Officer,
New Zealand Immigration
Subject: Letter of Explanation for Financial Guarantor’s Source of Income
Dear Sir / Madam,
I, Zay Yar Min, am the financial guarantor for my wife, Khin Khaing Zar Thein, in support of
her New Zealand student visa application. I am writing to provide clarification regarding the
source of my income and savings.
Employment and Income
I am employed as a Senior Software Development Manager at NETe2 Asia in Singapore,
where I have been working for the past 15 years. My current stable monthly salary is SGD
7,885 (excluding bonuses). All funds used to support my wife’s studies come exclusively from
my employment income.
To verify my employment and income, I have attached:
1. Certificate of Employment from NETe2 Asia confirming my position and salary
2. Payslips for the past 12 months
3. Income tax returns / Notices of Assessment for the last five years
Savings
We opened a UOB joint savings account in September 2019 with an initial deposit of
approximately SGD 50,000, funded from my salary. Since then, I have continued to make
regular deposits from my salary. All funds in this account originate from my employment income.
This account reflects our long-term savings and is sufficient to cover my wife’s tuition and living
expenses during her studies in New Zealand.
To verify this, I have attached a letter of reference from UOB Bank confirming the account
number, date of account opening, and current balance
I confirm that all information provided above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
The attached documents provide verifiable evidence of my employment income and savings,
demonstrating my financial capacity to fully support my wife’s tuition and living expenses during
her studies in New Zealand.
Sincerely,
Zay Yar Min
Senior Software Development Manager
