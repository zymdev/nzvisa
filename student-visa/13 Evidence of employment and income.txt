To Visa Officer,
New Zealand Immigration
Subject: Letter of Explanation for Source of Funds and Financial Guarantor
Dear Sir / Madam,
I am writing to clarify the source of funds in support of my New Zealand student visa application.
Employment and Income History
IT Trainer (Myan Yu Computer Training, Taunggyi, Myanmar)
I conducted small-scale private IT training classes, teaching basic applications and computer
fundamentals to individual learners and small groups. This generated limited income, and no
formal employment records or tax filings were issued at that time.
Administrative Executive (Ye Yint Pte Ltd, Singapore)
I worked with a monthly salary of SGD 1,500 (total annual income SGD 13,500). As Singapore
requires tax filing only for annual earnings above SGD 20,000, I was not required to file or pay
income tax.
Program Manager (Dr Htar Healthcare and Wellness Pte Ltd, Singapore)
This was a voluntary, unpaid role.
Household Income and Financial Guarantor
The primary source of household income is my husband, Zay Yar Min, Senior Software
Development Manager in Singapore, with a stable monthly salary of SGD 7,885. He has formally
declared himself as my financial guarantor by completing the INZ 1014 Financial Undertaking for a
Student form, attached with this application.
Documents Provided
● UOB joint account statements (showing account balance)
● Certificate of Employment from Ye Yint Pte Ltd
I confirm that the information above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. These
documents demonstrate that I am financially supported by my husband, with sufficient resources to
cover tuition and living expenses during my studies in New Zealand.

Sincerely,
Khin Khaing Zar Thein
