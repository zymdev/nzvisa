RE: Employment Reference - Khin Khaing Zar Thein

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to provide a reference for Mrs Khin Khaing Zar Thein who owned and operated Myan Yu Computer Training in Taunggyi, Myanmar where I worked as an instructor.

Mrs Khin established the training centre and was actively involved in running it from January 2010 to February 2015. She conducted small-scale private IT training classes, teaching basic applications and computer fundamentals to individual learners and small groups. In addition to managing the business, she also taught IT courses alongside the instructors she employed. I had the opportunity to work with her during this period and observed her teaching work directly.

She was skilled at breaking down complex technical concepts and explaining them in ways students could understand easily. As the owner and lead instructor, she managed course schedules, developed training materials, and ensured quality instruction. She demonstrated strong technical knowledge and was committed to providing good training to our students. I found her to be professional, organized, and dedicated to the training centre.

I understand she is planning to pursue a Master degree in Information Technology in New Zealand. This will help her update her technical skills with current technology developments.

Please contact me if you need any additional information.

Yours sincerely,

Nandar Win
Instructor
