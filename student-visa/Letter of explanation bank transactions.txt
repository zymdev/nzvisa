To Visa Officer, New Zealand Immigration
Subject: Letter of Explanation – Bank Transactions
Dear Sir / Madam,
I am writing to clarify the withdrawals and deposits reflected in the bank statement I submitted in support of my New Zealand visa application.
This account is our joint savings account, which we use for daily expenses, including my children’s school fees, insurance premiums, and utility bills.
Cash deposit in March 2025: After my return from Myanmar on 26 February 2025, my mother-in-law and my parents gave me approximately SGD 15,000 in cash to cover flight and hotel bookings, as well as travel expenses for their visits to Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam in March–April 2025. On 1 March 2025, I deposited this amount in two transactions of SGD 7,500 each due to the ATM limit.
Hotel and flight bookings: Transactions labeled “AGODA.COM ORCHARD HO INTERNET HK” refer to hotel bookings at Orchard Hotel Singapore for my parents and their siblings during their visit.
Cash withdrawals: On 26 March 2025, I withdrew SGD 1,500 and SGD 400 for my mother-in-law; on 9 April 2025, I withdrew SGD 1,000 and SGD 500 for my parents’ expenses. Because of these travel-related expenses, our spending in March and April 2025 was unusually high.
Savings transfer: On 1 July 2025, my husband transferred SGD 10,000 from his personal account into our joint account as part of our regular savings routine, unrelated to the March–April travel expenses.
Monthly bonus interest: Interest is received each month between the 2nd and 5th, depending on our spending.
I confirm that all transactions in the submitted bank statements are legitimate and reflect family and household expenses. I have attached all supporting documents for these transactions. I believe this explanation clarifies the nature and purpose of the transactions.
Sincerely,
Khin Khaing Zar Thein

Below are the highlighted transactions extracted from the UOB bank statement, along with booking reference screenshots. To keep this document concise, I have included only a few sample transactions of larger amounts for your review. Please note that the amounts on some receipts may not exactly match the bank transactions due to service charges or currency conversion, but each transaction relates directly to the documented bookings.
