## PURPOSE OF STUDY

### Why I Need This Master's Degree

My first Master of Information Science (completed in 2009, 16 years ago) provided a strong theoretical foundation in computer science. However, the technology landscape has transformed dramatically since then. Cloud computing, DevOps practices, agile methodologies, microservices architecture, and modern software development frameworks were either nascent or non-existent when I completed my first master's degree.

Despite my volunteer work involving Excel VBA development and mobile app management, I lack formal training and hands-on experience in contemporary enterprise-level software development, cloud architecture, business intelligence systems, and strategic IT leadership - skills that are essential for senior technical roles in today's competitive market.

My career progression has been limited by:
- A significant gap between my theoretical education (2009) and current industry practices
- Extended career break for childcare (2016-2021), during which technology evolved rapidly
- Volunteer-based work that, while valuable, does not provide the depth of technical challenge or professional recognition needed for career advancement
- Lack of industry-recognised qualifications in modern IT frameworks and methodologies

The Master of Information Technology at the University of Waikato will address these gaps by providing:
- Updated knowledge in software architecture, cloud computing, and enterprise systems
- Hands-on experience with contemporary development tools and methodologies
- Industry-relevant projects that demonstrate practical application of advanced concepts
- A globally recognised qualification from a QS-ranked institution that will significantly strengthen my professional profile

With both my daughters now in school full-time and no longer requiring constant care, this is the ideal time to invest in my professional development and position myself for meaningful career advancement.

### Detailed Comparison: Why My 2009 Master's Degree Is Insufficient

My Master of Information Science (2007-2009) provided theoretical computer science foundations but lacks the modern industry-relevant skills required for today's IT roles. The 16-year gap between my first master's and the proposed program represents a fundamental shift in technology and industry practices.

**Master of Information Science (2007-2009) - Subjects Studied:**
- Database Management System, Management Information System
- Numerical Methods, Dynamic Programming, Queuing Theory
- Artificial Intelligence, Analysis of Algorithms, Operating System
- Software Engineering, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
- Network and Communication, Object-Oriented Programming (C++, Java)

**Master of Information Technology (2026-2027) - Proposed Subjects:**
- **Programming Tools and Techniques (COMPX575)** - Modern development frameworks
- **Programming Project (COMPX576)** - Real-world application development
- **Cyber Security Operations (COMPX511)** - Securing IT systems against modern threats
- **Security for Advanced Networks (COMPX515)** - IoT and Software-Defined Networks
- **Secure Cloud Application Engineering (COMPX527)** - Cloud-native application development
- **Information Visualisation (COMPX532)** - Data presentation and business intelligence
- **Usability Engineering (COMPX539)** - User-centered design principles
- **Computer Science Internship (CSMAX596, 60 points)** - Supervised industry experience in New Zealand

**Key Differences:**

My 2009 curriculum focused on traditional computer science theory. The proposed program addresses critical modern competencies that did not exist or were not mainstream in 2009:
- **Cloud Computing:** AWS launched 2006, Azure 2010 - neither were part of my original curriculum
- **Modern Security:** Ransomware, cloud vulnerabilities, and advanced network threats have emerged post-2009
- **Industry Internship:** 400-hour supervised internship provides practical experience essential for career re-entry after my career break
- **Contemporary Frameworks:** Modern development tools, DevOps practices, and agile methodologies were not covered in my previous degree

Singapore's employers require current, industry-relevant qualifications. My 2009 master's degree, while providing valuable foundation, does not meet the technical requirements for mid-to-senior IT positions in today's competitive job market.

### How This Degree Aligns With My Career Goals

The IT and tech industry is highly competitive, with employers seeking candidates who possess both advanced qualifications and up-to-date technical skills. Many senior technical roles - such as Solutions Architect, IT Business Analyst, Technical Project Manager, and Development Manager - require master's degrees or equivalent certifications. This creates significant competition among candidates, and those with relevant advanced qualifications are offered substantially higher salaries and better career progression opportunities.

With this master's degree, I will gain the knowledge, practical skills, and professional credentials necessary to transition from volunteer work to paid senior technical positions in Singapore's thriving IT sector. The qualification will enable me to contribute meaningfully to enterprise-level projects, work alongside my husband in the technology industry, and establish a strong professional reputation.

## WHY UNIVERSITY OF WAIKATO

I chose the University of Waikato for its 180-point Master of Information Technology program, which combines advanced coursework with a structured 400-hour credit-bearing internship supervised by industry mentors and academic staff. This unique feature provides the practical, hands-on experience I need to update my professional skills and regain confidence after my career break. The program specifically addresses the technical gaps I need to fill with core papers in Software Architecture, Business Intelligence, Project Management, and Enterprise Systems.

Waikato offers internationally recognized qualifications in a supportive learning environment, and its location in Hamilton is advantageous as my husband's cousin, Pyay Mon Kyaw, and close friend, Nyein Chan Swe, live in New Zealand and have provided supporting letters included in my application. The program can be completed in 12 months through the February intake, allowing me to return to Singapore promptly without extended separation from my family or disruption to my children's education. The balance of academic rigor, industry-focused learning with the internship component, and international exposure directly aligns with my career goals.

## WHY NEW ZEALAND

I chose New Zealand for its high-quality, internationally recognized education, which emphasizes a hands-on, practical, and research-focused approach. The academic environment is known for being supportive and less stressful, allowing students to fully engage with advanced IT concepts and apply them effectively. As an English-speaking country with low crime rates and political stability, it provides an ideal learning environment where I can focus on my studies while strengthening my professional communication skills.

I also value New Zealand's unique culture and cool climate, which is similar to my hometown of Taunggyi, Shan State, Myanmar. As someone who enjoys traveling and exploring cultures, a passion reflected in my well-stamped passport, I look forward to engaging with New Zealand's multicultural society and developing international connections that will support my academic and professional growth. New Zealand's practical education philosophy emphasizes applied learning and real-world problem-solving, which aligns perfectly with my goal of acquiring immediately applicable technical skills.

## FINANCIAL CAPACITY

I have secured comprehensive financial arrangements to cover all tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs for the entire duration of my Master of Information Technology program without financial hardship.

### Sources of Funding

My husband, Zay Yar Min, is my primary financial sponsor. He is employed as a Senior Software Development Manager in Singapore with stable employment for 15 years and a substantial monthly salary that comfortably supports our family's living expenses and my education costs.

### Detailed Financial Evidence

I am providing the following financial documents to demonstrate our capacity:
- "Bank Statements.pdf" - Joint bank statements showing savings of over SGD 140,000 (approximately NZD 180,000)
- "Financial guarantor employment and income.pdf" - My husband's Certificate of Employment, 12 months of payslips, and IRAS tax assessment documents (Notices of Assessment 2021-2025)
- "Evidence of Family and Financial Commitments.pdf" - Property ownership documents for five plots of land in Myanmar (three registered in my name, two in my husband's name)

Our available funds of SGD 140,000 (approximately NZD 180,000) ensure I will have sufficient financial resources throughout my studies without requiring employment or external support.

## CLARIFIED POST-STUDY PLANS

I provide detailed clarification about my intentions after completing my studies with two clear phases:

### Phase 1: Immediate Return to Singapore

Upon completing my Master of Information Technology in February 2027, I will immediately return to Singapore to rejoin my husband and daughters and establish my professional career. Singapore is currently our family's home, and I have compelling, concrete reasons to return:

**1. Family Obligations**

My husband, Zay Yar Min, will remain in Singapore throughout my studies, continuing his established career as a Senior Software Development Manager. We have been together since 2008 (19 years) and married since April 2015 (12 years). Separating our family for 12 months is already a significant sacrifice; extending this separation beyond the study period is neither desirable nor feasible.

Both our daughters were born in Singapore and have lived their entire lives there:
- May La Min (born 26 May 2016) will be 10 years old when I complete my studies in February 2027. She is currently in Primary 3 and will be in Primary 4, with her crucial Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) approaching in 2028.
- Kyal Sin Khaing (born 1 September 2019) will be 7 years old and in Primary 1, establishing her foundation years in Singapore's education system.

Disrupting their education, friendships, and social development by relocating them from Singapore would be detrimental to their well-being. As their mother, my responsibility is to support their education and provide stability during their formative years. This requires my presence in Singapore, where their schools, friends, extended social networks, and father are located.

**2. Singapore as Our Family's Cultural and Social Home**

My children identify as Singaporean in all but legal status. They speak English as their first language, with Mandarin as their second language - both acquired through Singapore's education system. They have Singaporean friends, celebrate Singapore's national holidays, and participate in local community activities. Their entire childhood, memories, and social identity are rooted in Singapore.

My husband has lived in Singapore continuously since 2010 (15 years as of 2025, 17 years by 2027). Our family's social network, daily routines, cultural practices, and way of life are comprehensively Singaporean. We maintain friendships with local families, demonstrating the international nature of our Singapore-based network.

Leaving Singapore would mean abandoning the only home our children have ever known and severing the social and cultural connections that define our family life.

**3. Economic and Professional Opportunities in Singapore**

Singapore offers superior career opportunities, higher salaries, and better economic stability. Additionally, Singapore's proximity to Myanmar makes it easier to maintain family connections, with only a 3-hour flight to visit our parents and relatives regularly.

## CAREER ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN SINGAPORE

Upon returning to Singapore with my Master of Information Technology, I will pursue technical positions in established companies and multinational corporations. I am targeting the following prospective companies and positions that align directly with my study program:

a. **Application Developer** – ST Engineering, Accenture Singapore, NCS Pte Ltd – SGD 5,000 to 7,000 per month  
*Aligned with coursework:* COMPX575 Programming Tools and Techniques, COMPX576 Programming Project

b. **Cloud Engineer** – DBS Bank, Singtel, Amazon Web Services – SGD 6,000 to 9,000 per month  
*Aligned with coursework:* COMPX527 Secure Cloud Application Engineering

c. **Software Engineer** – Grab, Foodpanda, Lazada, Shopee – SGD 4,500 to 6,500 per month  
*Aligned with coursework:* COMPX575, COMPX576, COMPX539 Usability Engineering

d. **Cyber Security Analyst** – Singapore Airlines, Changi Airport Group, Government Technology Agency – SGD 5,500 to 8,000 per month  
*Aligned with coursework:* COMPX511 Cyber Security Operations, COMPX515 Security for Advanced Networks, COMPX527 Secure Cloud Application Engineering

### Why Singapore's IT Market Requires Master's Qualifications

Singapore's IT sector experiences persistent shortage of qualified professionals, with the government actively encouraging upskilling through initiatives like TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA). As a multinational hub hosting regional headquarters for major technology and financial companies, Singapore offers competitive compensation and clear career progression pathways.

**Market Evidence (verified through MyCareersFuture.gov.sg, December 2025):**
- Application Developer positions: SGD 4,000-10,500 monthly (master's holders command higher range)
- Cloud Engineer positions: SGD 5,500-14,000 monthly (specialized roles require advanced qualifications)
- Software Engineer positions: SGD 3,000-20,000 monthly (wide range based on qualifications and experience)
- Cyber Security Analyst positions: SGD 4,000-10,000 monthly (government and enterprise roles prefer master's degrees)

**Competitive Advantage of Master's Degree:**

Candidates with master's degrees in Singapore's IT sector typically earn 20-30% higher starting salaries compared to those with only bachelor's degrees. More importantly, many mid-to-senior positions explicitly require or strongly prefer master's qualifications. Without this credential, I would be competing for entry-level positions despite my previous education and experience.

**Career Progression Pathway:**

My realistic career trajectory after completing this master's degree:

1. **Year 1-2 (2027-2029):** Entry to mid-level technical role (Application Developer or Software Engineer) at SGD 5,000-6,000 monthly, building practical experience and industry reputation

2. **Year 3-5 (2029-2032):** Mid-level specialist role (Cloud Engineer or Cyber Security Analyst) at SGD 7,000-9,000 monthly, leveraging master's qualification and demonstrated capabilities

3. **Year 6-10 (2032-2037):** Senior technical or leadership role (Technical Lead, Solutions Architect, IT Manager) at SGD 10,000-15,000 monthly, comparable to my husband's current level

This pathway is realistic and achievable with a current, relevant master's qualification from an internationally recognized institution. Without this degree, I remain constrained to volunteer or administrative work, unable to contribute meaningfully to our family's financial future.

### Maintained Connection to Myanmar as Country of Citizenship

As Myanmar citizens, my husband and I maintain meaningful connections to our home country, though our immediate and medium-term life is firmly established in Singapore.

**Property and Family in Myanmar:**

We own five plots of land in Myanmar (three registered in my name, two in my husband's name) representing significant financial assets and long-term investments. Both our parents and extended families reside in Myanmar. We visit regularly to maintain family relationships and ensure our children understand their cultural heritage. We speak Burmese at home and celebrate Myanmar traditions as part of our family identity.

**Realistic Timeline:**

I acknowledge that I have resided outside Myanmar continuously since 2015 (10 years), and my children have lived their entire lives in Singapore. My travel history shows visits to Myanmar in February and April 2025 after an extended period, reflecting our current reality: Singapore is our home, Myanmar is our heritage.

Any potential return to Myanmar would only be feasible in the distant future (10-15+ years), after:
- My children complete their education in Singapore (2030s)
- My husband and I complete our professional careers in Singapore
- Myanmar's economic and political situation stabilizes to support sustainable business opportunities
- Our parents' care needs require our physical presence

My immediate obligation is to return to Singapore after completing this master's degree in February 2027. This is driven by concrete, non-negotiable commitments: my husband's employment, my daughters' education, and our family's established life in Singapore over the past decade.

## TRAVEL HISTORY AND IMMIGRATION COMPLIANCE

I have a well-established travel history demonstrating compliance with visa conditions and timely departures from countries visited. My recent international travels include South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and Myanmar. A detailed travel history document with complete dates, destinations and supporting passport stamps is provided separately as "Travel History.pdf".

My passport shows consistent patterns of respecting visa conditions, departing countries before visa expiration, and returning to Singapore as my base with no overstaying or immigration violations in any country.

I acknowledge that my travel history shows visits to Myanmar in February and April 2025 after an extended period of residence in Singapore. This reflects the reality that Singapore has been my family's primary home since 2015, where my husband works, my children attend school, and our daily life is established. Our visits to Myanmar are for family purposes (visiting parents and relatives) rather than indication of current residence or immediate relocation plans.

## ASSURANCE AND COMMITMENT TO RETURNING TO SINGAPORE

I understand the importance of demonstrating genuine intent to comply with visa conditions and leave New Zealand when required. I provide the following concrete assurances:

**1. Family Separation is Temporary**

The 12-month separation from my husband and daughters is already a significant emotional and practical challenge. Extending this separation beyond the study period would be unacceptable to our family. My children need their mother, and my husband needs his wife. We are a close-knit family unit, and prolonged separation is not sustainable or desirable.

**2. Children's Education Cannot Be Disrupted**

My daughters' education in Singapore is non-negotiable. They are enrolled in established schools, have friendship groups, and are progressing through Singapore's education system. Relocating them to New Zealand would disrupt their education, require starting over in a new system, and negatively impact their academic and social development.

May La Min will be preparing for her Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) in 2028, which determines her secondary school placement. My presence in Singapore is essential to support her through this critical academic milestone.

**3. Employment Pass and Long-Term Stay Considerations**

My husband holds a Singapore Employment Pass tied to his employment at NETe2 Asia, which requires him to remain in Singapore. His Employment Pass provides the legal basis for our family's residence, and maintaining his employment is essential for our family's ability to stay in Singapore.

Both of my daughters will be applying for Permanent Residence (PR) when they complete their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), as children who have completed their primary education in Singapore have higher success rates for PR applications. These potential PR applications represent our family's long-term commitment to Singapore and create a strong incentive to return immediately after my studies.

## DECLARATION AND COMMITMENT

As an applicant for a student visa to New Zealand, I fully commit to all immigration rules and regulations set forth by Immigration New Zealand. I understand and accept the following conditions:

1. Study Commitment: I will maintain full-time enrolment at the University of Waikato, attend all required classes, and make satisfactory academic progress throughout my program.
2. Work Restrictions: I will adhere to all work limitations specified in my student visa conditions and will not breach these restrictions.
3. Legal Compliance: I will abide by all New Zealand laws and regulations during my stay, including reporting requirements and maintaining valid visa status.
4. Timely Departure: I will depart New Zealand immediately upon completing my Master of Information Technology program in February 2027, returning to Singapore to rejoin my family as outlined in this statement.
5. No Overstaying: I will not overstay my visa or attempt to remain in New Zealand beyond the authorized period under any circumstances.
6. Financial Independence: I will rely on my pre-arranged financial support from my husband and will not become a burden on New Zealand's public services or social welfare systems.

I recognize that failure to comply with these conditions could result in visa cancellation, deportation, and future immigration consequences. I take these obligations seriously and commit to upholding the highest standards of conduct during my studies in New Zealand.

I have provided this detailed statement to demonstrate with concrete evidence my genuine intent to study, comply with visa conditions, and return to Singapore immediately upon completing my program. My immediate goal is clear: obtain advanced IT qualifications from the University of Waikato and return to Singapore to advance my career while supporting my family's established life there.

## CONCLUSION

In summary, this application demonstrates:

1. **Genuine Study Intent:** I have provided comprehensive explanation of why the Master of Information Technology is essential for my career advancement, including detailed comparison with my outdated 2009 degree, explanation of the 16-year technology gap, and rationale for why short courses are insufficient.

2. **Post-Study Plans:** I have provided realistic, evidence-based plans to return immediately to Singapore with specific job targets, salary ranges, career progression pathways, and direct alignment between my coursework and target employment opportunities.

3. **Strong Ties Requiring Return:** I have demonstrated compelling obligations to Singapore: my husband's 15-year established career with documented S Pass, my daughters' entire lives and education in Singapore (including critical PSLE preparation in 2028), our 10-year family residence, and planned PR applications in 2026.

4. **Complete Documentation:** I have provided comprehensive supporting documents addressing all visa requirements, with explicit references throughout this statement to guide assessment of each concern raised in the previous application.

I am a 40-year-old mother of two who has made significant sacrifices in my career to raise my children and support my husband's career. Now that my children are older and in school full-time, I am committed to advancing my professional qualifications to contribute meaningfully to my family's financial future and establish my own career identity.

My request is straightforward: allow me to study at the University of Waikato for 12 months to obtain current, relevant IT qualifications, after which I will immediately return to Singapore to rejoin my husband and daughters, pursue professional IT positions, and build my career while supporting my children through their critical education years.

I am committed to following all immigration rules and regulations, respecting New Zealand's laws, and representing my country positively during my studies. I appreciate your careful consideration of this application and the opportunity to address all concerns raised in the previous assessment.

Thank you very much for your time and thorough review of this application.

Yours sincerely,

Khin Khaing Zar Thein
