**To:** Visa Officer, New Zealand Immigration
**Subject:** Evidence of Relationship Between Student and Financial Guarantor

Dear Immigration Officer,

I am writing to provide evidence of my genuine and stable relationship with my wife, Khin Khaing Zar Thein (Passport: MI071193), who is applying for a student visa to pursue a Master of Information Technology at the University of Waikato, commencing February 2026. I am her husband and financial guarantor.

### OUR RELATIONSHIP HISTORY

My wife and I have been together since 2008 (19 years total, 12 years married). We met in Myanmar and built our relationship before I relocated to Singapore for employment in 2010.

**Timeline of Our Relationship:**

- **2008:** We began our relationship in Myanmar
- **2010:** I relocated to Singapore for employment at NETe2 Asia
- **2010-2015:** We maintained our relationship across countries, with regular visits
- **3 April 2015:** We married in Singapore (Marriage Certificate enclosed)
- **June 2015:** My wife relocated to Singapore on a Dependant Pass linked to my Employment Pass
- **26 May 2016:** Birth of our first daughter, May La Min, in Singapore
- **1 September 2019:** Birth of our second daughter, Kyal Sin Khaing, in Singapore
- **2015-Present:** Living together continuously as a family in Singapore (10 years)

### EVIDENCE OF COHABITATION

We have lived together continuously in Singapore since June 2015, sharing the same address throughout our marriage:

- **2015-2016:** 2A Cambridge Village, Cambridge Road, #04-07, Singapore 219679 (documented in our marriage certificate)
- **2016-2017:** 63 Tampines Avenue 1, #15-05, Singapore 529777 (documented in May La Min's birth certificate)
- **2017-Present:** 139 Pasir Ris Street 11, #07-195, Singapore 510139 (our current family residence for 8 years)

Our continuous cohabitation is verified through:
- Singapore Housing Development Board (HDB) tenant records showing both our names
- Utility bills in both our names at our current address
- Joint bank account statements showing shared financial management
- Children's birth certificates listing both parents at the same address
- Singapore Dependant Pass records (my wife's pass linked to my Employment Pass since June 2015)

### OUR FAMILY LIFE

**Our Daughters:**
- May La Min (9 years old, born 26 May 2016)
- Kyal Sin Khaing (6 years old, born 1 September 2019)

Both daughters were born in Singapore and hold Singapore Student Passes for their primary education.

### SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION

The following photographs demonstrate the genuine and stable nature of our relationship throughout the years:

These photographs collectively demonstrate that our relationship is genuine, stable, and ongoing. We have built our family life together over 19 years, with 10 years of continuous cohabitation in Singapore. My wife's temporary absence for studies does not change our commitment to our marriage and family.

Should you require any additional information or documentation regarding our relationship, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,

**Zay Yar Min**  
Senior Software Development Manager, NETe2 Asia
