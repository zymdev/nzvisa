Dear Immigration Officer,

My name is Khin Khaing Zar Thein, 40 years old, married with two children, and a law-abiding citizen of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, holding passport number MI071193.

I am writing this letter to apply for a Student Visa to complete a Master of Information Technology at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, where I have been accepted. My program will commence in February 2026.

PERSONAL AND FAMILY BACKGROUND

I am married to Zay Yar Min, who is currently employed as a Senior Software Development Manager at NETe2 Asia in Singapore since October 2010 (15 years of continuous employment). We have two daughters: May La Min (9 years old, born 26 May 2016 in Singapore) and Kyal Sin Khaing (6 years old, born 1 September 2019 in Singapore).

Both children are currently studying in Singapore. May La Min holds a student pass and will be attending Primary 4 next year. Kyal Sin Khaing will be attending Primary 1 next year, and her student pass has recently been approved.

Singapore has become our family's second home. My husband has worked there continuously since 2010 (15 years), and our entire family life - from our daughters' births to their education and social development - is deeply rooted in Singapore. We maintain our primary residence at 139 Pasir Ris Street 11, #07-195, Singapore 510139. Additionally, one of my siblings is also working in Singapore, further strengthening our family connections there. Evidence of my children's Student Passes and Letters of Certification from their primary schools are provided in "Evidence of my situation and plans.pdf".

Why I Have Not Worked in Paid IT Roles Since Moving to Singapore

When I relocated to Singapore in June 2015 following my husband's established employment, I immediately encountered a significant challenge: my Myanmar IT qualifications and IT training business experience did not meet Singapore's competitive software engineering industry requirements.

Singapore's technology sector demands current, practical expertise in modern frameworks and industry-standard tools. My 2009 Master of Information Science provided theoretical foundations but lacked the hands-on experience with contemporary technologies that Singapore employers require. Software engineering positions I explored required demonstrated expertise in cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), modern development frameworks, agile methodologies, and industry certifications - none of which were part of my 2009 curriculum or IT training business experience.

From June 2015 to March 2016, I worked as Administrative Executive at Ye Yint Pte Ltd while adjusting to life in Singapore and preparing for our first daughter's birth. Following her birth in May 2016 and our second daughter's birth in September 2019, I focused on childcare during their crucial early years (2016-2021).

Since September 2021, I have volunteered as Program Manager at Dr Htar Healthcare and Wellness, applying my IT knowledge through Excel VBA development and mobile app management. While this work maintains my technical engagement, volunteer activities do not provide the structured career progression, professional recognition, or financial independence that paid IT employment offers.

PURPOSE OF STUDY

Why I Need This Master's Degree

My first Master of Information Science (completed in 2009, 16 years ago) provided a strong theoretical foundation in computer science. However, the technology landscape has transformed dramatically since then. Cloud computing, DevOps practices, agile methodologies, microservices architecture, and modern software development frameworks were either nascent or non-existent when I completed my first master's degree.

Despite my volunteer work involving Excel VBA development and mobile app management, I lack formal training and hands-on experience in contemporary enterprise-level software development, cloud architecture, business intelligence systems, and strategic IT leadership - skills that are essential for senior technical roles in today's competitive market.

My career progression has been limited by:

- A significant gap between my theoretical education (2009) and current industry practices
- Extended career break for childcare (2016-2021), during which technology evolved rapidly
- Volunteer-based work that, while valuable, does not provide the depth of technical challenge or professional recognition needed for career advancement
- Lack of industry-recognised qualifications in modern IT frameworks and methodologies

The Master of Information Technology at the University of Waikato will address these gaps by providing:

- Updated knowledge in software architecture, cloud computing, and enterprise systems
- Hands-on experience with contemporary development tools and methodologies
- Industry-relevant projects that demonstrate practical application of advanced concepts
- A globally recognised qualification from a QS-ranked institution that will significantly strengthen my professional profile

With both my daughters now in school full-time and no longer requiring constant care, this is the ideal time to invest in my professional development and position myself for meaningful career advancement.

Detailed Comparison: Why My 2009 Master's Degree Is Insufficient

My Master of Information Science (2007-2009) provided theoretical computer science foundations but lacks the modern industry-relevant skills required for today's IT roles. The 16-year gap represents a fundamental shift in technology and industry practices.

**Master of Information Science (2007-2009):** Database Management, Management Information System, Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Object-Oriented Programming (C++, Java), Network and Communication

**Master of Information Technology (2026-2027):** Modern development frameworks, Cyber Security Operations, Secure Cloud Application Engineering, Information Visualisation, Usability Engineering, and 400-hour supervised industry internship

**Key Differences:**

My 2009 curriculum focused on traditional computer science theory. The proposed program addresses critical modern competencies that did not exist or were not mainstream in 2009:

- **Cloud Computing:** AWS and Azure were not part of my original curriculum
- **Modern Security:** Ransomware, cloud vulnerabilities, and advanced network threats have emerged post-2009
- **Industry Internship:** 400-hour supervised internship provides practical experience essential for career re-entry
- **Contemporary Frameworks:** Modern development tools, DevOps practices, and agile methodologies were not covered

Singapore's employers require current, industry-relevant qualifications. My 2009 master's degree, while providing valuable foundation, does not meet the technical requirements for mid-to-senior IT positions in today's competitive job market.

New Zealand's education system offers a distinct practical, industry-focused approach that differs significantly from my previous theoretical Myanmar education. The University of Waikato's programme emphasizes hands-on application, real-world problem-solving, and workplace readiness through its 400-hour supervised internship - exactly what I need to transition from IT training business ownership to software engineering employment in Singapore.

How This Degree Aligns With My Career Goals

I have chosen the University of Waikato's 180-point Master of Information Technology program because it combines advanced coursework with a structured 400-hour credit-bearing internship supervised by industry mentors and academic staff. This unique feature provides the practical, hands-on experience I need to update my professional skills and regain confidence after my career break. The program can be completed in 12 months through the February 2026 intake, allowing me to return to Singapore promptly in February 2027 without extended separation from my family or disruption to my children's education. A detailed study plan showing how each course supports my Singapore career goals is provided in "Study Plan and Details of Intended Subjects.pdf".

New Zealand offers high-quality, internationally recognized education with a supportive learning environment that emphasizes practical, applied learning and real-world problem-solving - exactly what I need to transition from volunteer work to paid senior technical positions in Singapore's thriving IT sector. Singapore's Master of IT programs do not offer the same credit-bearing 400-hour supervised internship component that is essential for my career re-entry after an extended career break. With this qualification, I will gain the knowledge, practical skills, and professional credentials necessary to contribute meaningfully to enterprise-level projects, work alongside my husband in the technology industry, and establish a strong professional reputation.

FINANCIAL CAPACITY

I have secured comprehensive financial arrangements to cover all tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs for the entire duration of my program.

Sources of Funding

My husband, Zay Yar Min, is my primary financial sponsor. He is employed as a Senior Software Development Manager in Singapore with stable employment for 15 years and a substantial monthly salary that comfortably supports our family's living expenses and my education costs.

Detailed Financial Evidence

I am providing the following financial documents to demonstrate our capacity:

- "Bank Statements.pdf" - Joint bank statements showing savings of over SGD 140,000 (approximately NZD 180,000)
- "Evidence of the Financial Guarantor Employment and Income.pdf" - My husband's Certificate of Employment, Employment Pass, 12 months of payslips, and IRAS tax assessment documents (Notices of Assessment 2021-2025)
- "Evidence of my situation and plans.pdf" - Family commitments, property ownership, community involvement, and post-study career plans

Our available funds of SGD 140,000 (approximately NZD 180,000) ensure I will have sufficient financial resources throughout my studies without requiring employment or external support.

CLARIFIED POST-STUDY PLANS

I provide detailed clarification about my intentions after completing my studies with two clear phases:

Phase 1: Immediate Return to Singapore

Upon completing my Master of Information Technology in February 2027, I will immediately return to Singapore to rejoin my husband and daughters and establish my professional career. Singapore is currently our family's home, and I have compelling, concrete reasons to return:

1. Family Obligations

My husband, Zay Yar Min, will remain in Singapore throughout my studies, continuing his established career as a Senior Software Development Manager. We have been together since 2008 (19 years) and married since April 2015 (12 years). Separating our family for 12 months is already a significant sacrifice; extending this separation beyond the study period is neither desirable nor feasible.

Both our daughters were born in Singapore and have lived their entire lives there:

May La Min (born 26 May 2016) will be 10 years old when I complete my studies, progressing through primary school
Kyal Sin Khaing (born 1 September 2019) will be 7 years old, in Primary 1

Disrupting their education, friendships, and social development by relocating them from Singapore would be detrimental to their well-being. As their mother, my responsibility is to support their education and provide stability during their formative years in Singapore, where their schools, friends, and father are located.

2. Singapore as Our Family's Cultural and Social Home

My children identify as Singaporean in all but legal status. They speak English and Mandarin, have Singaporean friends, and their entire childhood, memories, and social identity are rooted in Singapore. Leaving would mean abandoning the only home they have ever known.

3. Economic and Professional Opportunities in Singapore

Singapore offers superior career opportunities, higher salaries, and better economic stability. Additionally, Singapore's proximity to Myanmar makes it easier to maintain family connections, with only a 3-hour flight to visit our parents and relatives regularly.

CAREER ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN SINGAPORE

Upon returning to Singapore with my Master of Information Technology, I will pursue technical positions in established companies and multinational corporations. I am targeting the following prospective companies and positions:

- **Application Developer** – ST Engineering, Accenture Singapore, NCS Pte Ltd – SGD 5,000 to 7,000 per month
- **Cloud Engineer** – DBS Bank, Singtel, Amazon Web Services – SGD 6,000 to 9,000 per month
- **Software Engineer** – Grab, Foodpanda, Lazada, Shopee – SGD 4,500 to 6,500 per month
- **Cyber Security Analyst** – Singapore Airlines, Changi Airport Group, Government Technology Agency – SGD 5,500 to 8,000 per month

With my updated qualifications, I can pursue meaningful IT career opportunities in Singapore's competitive technology sector, transitioning from volunteer work to paid professional positions that utilize my advanced skills and contribute to our family's financial future.

Phase 2: Long-Term Return to Myanmar

As Myanmar citizens, my husband and I maintain strong connections to our home country, though our immediate and medium-term life is firmly established in Singapore.

**Family Ties in Myanmar:**
Both our parents reside in Myanmar. I have four siblings in total: one is working in Singapore (strengthening our Singapore ties), and three remain in Myanmar. My father, Khin Maung Thein, operates Myan Yu Cargo Terminal, a licensed private cargo terminal business in Taunggyi Township. Evidence of my father's business license, family household registration, and family photos are provided in "Evidence of my situation and plans.pdf".

**Property Ownership in Myanmar:**
We own five plots of land in Myanmar (three registered in my name, two in my husband's name) with an estimated current combined value exceeding SGD 190,000. These represent significant financial assets and long-term investments in our home country.

**Long-Term Plans:**
We visit Myanmar regularly to maintain family relationships and ensure our children understand their cultural heritage. We celebrate Myanmar traditions as part of our family identity. My long-term plan is to return to Myanmar in the distant future (5-10+ years), after my children complete their education in Singapore, and Myanmar's economic and political situation stabilizes to support sustainable business opportunities. My family's business in Myanmar provides a foundation for potential future involvement.

ASSURANCE AND COMMITMENT TO RETURNING TO SINGAPORE

I understand the importance of demonstrating genuine intent to comply with visa conditions and leave New Zealand when required. I provide the following concrete assurances:

1. Family Separation is Temporary

The 12-month separation from my husband and daughters is already a significant emotional and practical challenge. Extending this separation beyond the study period would be unacceptable to our family. My children need their mother, and my husband needs his wife. We are a close-knit family unit, and prolonged separation is not sustainable or desirable.

2. Children's Education in Singapore

My daughters are currently enrolled in schools in Singapore where they are progressing through their primary education. May La Min will be preparing for her Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) in 2028. As their mother, I want to return to Singapore to support their education and be present during these important academic years.

3. Long-Term Singapore Residence

My husband holds a Singapore Employment Pass tied to his employment at NETe2 Asia, which requires him to remain in Singapore. His Employment Pass provides the legal basis for our family's residence, and maintaining his employment is essential for our family's ability to stay in Singapore.

DECLARATION AND COMMITMENT

I fully commit to all immigration rules and regulations set forth by Immigration New Zealand. I will maintain full-time enrollment at the University of Waikato, comply with all visa conditions including work restrictions, and depart New Zealand immediately upon completing my program in February 2027 to return to Singapore. I will not overstay my visa or attempt to remain in New Zealand beyond the authorized period. I recognize the serious consequences of non-compliance and commit to upholding the highest standards of conduct during my studies.

CONCLUSION

In summary, this application demonstrates:

1. **Genuine Study Intent:** I have provided comprehensive explanation of why the Master of Information Technology is essential for my career advancement, including detailed comparison with my outdated 2009 degree, explanation of the 16-year technology gap, and rationale for why short courses are insufficient.

2. **Post-Study Plans:** I have provided realistic, evidence-based plans to return immediately to Singapore with specific job targets, salary ranges, career progression pathways, and direct alignment between my coursework and target employment opportunities.

3. **Strong Ties Requiring Return:** I have demonstrated compelling obligations to Singapore: my husband's 15-year established career with documented Employment Pass, my daughters' entire lives and education in Singapore (including critical PSLE preparation in 2028), and our family's established residence there.

I am a 40-year-old mother of two who has made significant sacrifices in my career to raise my children and support my husband's career. Now that my children are older and in school full-time, I am committed to advancing my professional qualifications to contribute meaningfully to my family's financial future and establish my own career identity.

My request is straightforward: allow me to study at the University of Waikato for 12 months to obtain current, relevant IT qualifications, after which I will immediately return to Singapore to rejoin my husband and daughters, pursue professional IT positions, and build my career while supporting my children through their critical education years.

I am committed to following all immigration rules and regulations, respecting New Zealand's laws, and representing my country positively during my studies. I appreciate your careful consideration of this application.

Thank you very much for your time and thorough review of this application.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I acknowledge that I previously applied for a student visa (Application Number: SV02080405) which was declined on 14 November 2025. I have carefully reviewed the reasons for the decline and this application addresses all concerns with comprehensive supporting evidence.

Yours sincerely,
