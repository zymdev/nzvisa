Subject: Relationship Evidence
Dear Sir / Madam,
I am writing to provide evidence of my genuine and stable relationship with my husband, Zay Yar
Min, who will also be my financial guarantor for my studies in New Zealand.
Both my husband and I are originally from Taunggyi, Myanmar, and we first met in Yangon in
May 2008. In 2010, my husband moved to Singapore for work, and although we lived apart during
that period, we maintained a close relationship through regular communication and his visits back
to Myanmar.
In 2015, I moved to Singapore, and we were married on 3 April 2015. Since then, we have been
living together in Singapore. We have built a strong and stable family life, and we are blessed with
two children, born in 2016 and 2019, both in Singapore.
To support this, I will attach:
● Our marriage certificate
● Birth certificates of our two children
● Joint bank account statements
● A supporting letter from my husband’s cousin confirming our relationship
● Family photographs taken over the years
I trust this evidence clearly demonstrates the authenticity and stability of our marriage, and
confirms that my husband is able and committed to act as my financial guarantor for the duration of
my studies in New Zealand.

Yours sincerely,
Khin Khaing Zar Thein
