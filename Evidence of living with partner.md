**Subject:** Evidence I have been living with my partner

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to provide evidence that I have been living with my partner, Khin Khaing Zar Thein, continuously since our marriage in April 2015.

We have maintained a continuous shared household in Singapore throughout our marriage of more than 10 years. We have never had any significant periods of separation, and have lived together as a family unit since April 2015.

## Our residential history and shared household

Since our marriage, we have lived at three addresses in Singapore as our family has grown:

**April 2015:** 2A Cambridge Village, Cambridge Road, #04-07, Singapore 219679  
This was our first marital home after our marriage in April 2015. Utility bills from this period show both our names at this address.

**2016 – 2017:** 63 Tampines Avenue 1, #15-05, Singapore 529777  
We moved here when our family expanded. Utility bills from this period show both our names at this address.

**2017 – Present:** 139 Pasir Ris Street 11, #07-195, Singapore 510139  
We have been living at our current address since 2017. We have comprehensive evidence of our shared residence here including:

- **Tenancy agreements** showing both our names
- **HDB resident list** exported from Singapore government website showing our family
- **Utility bills** from 2017 to present at our current address
- **UOB joint bank account** statements showing both names and current address

As the main income earner for our family, I manage all household expenses through our joint bank account. We make joint decisions regarding our housing and family living arrangements. Our daily life is fully integrated as a family unit, with shared household management, childcare responsibilities, and family planning decisions.

## Supporting documents attached

1. **Tenancy agreements** with both names at current address
2. **Utility bills** from all three addresses showing residence at each location
3. **HDB resident list** from Singapore government website confirming family residence
4. **UOB joint bank account statements** showing both names and current address

This evidence demonstrates continuous cohabitation for more than 10 years since our marriage.

**Yours sincerely,**

**Zay Yar Min**
