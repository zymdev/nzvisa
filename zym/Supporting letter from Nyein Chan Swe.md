To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to support my friend Zay Yar Min and his wife Khin Khaing Zar Thein with their visa applications to New Zealand. I have known this family since 2021 when we met in Singapore, and I moved to New Zealand in September 2024.

In Singapore, our families became very close friends. We both have two daughters of similar ages, so our kids played together regularly and we had family gatherings often. I got to know Zay Yar Min and Khin Khaing Zar Thein as a loving couple and devoted parents who work well together in raising their children.

Khin Khaing Zar Thein is a caring mother and intelligent woman who has always wanted to continue her education. Zay Yar Min is a responsible father and supportive husband. Their children are well-behaved and happy, showing the stable family environment they've created.

Even after moving to New Zealand, we keep in touch regularly through WhatsApp and video calls. I live in Gisborne, about 5 hours from Hamilton where the University of Waikato is located, so I'll be able to help them settle in when they arrive.

This family will be great additions to the New Zealand community. They are honest, hardworking people who value education and family. I'm happy to support them and look forward to helping them during their time here.

Please contact me if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Nyein Chan Swe
