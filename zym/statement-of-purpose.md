**New Zealand Immigration**

**Subject:** Partner of a Student Work Visa Application - Statement of Purpose

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to support my application for a Partner of a Student Work Visa to accompany my wife, Khin Khaing Zar Thein, during her Master of Information Technology studies at University of Waikato. I am a Myanmar citizen currently residing in Singapore as a Senior Software Development Manager with 15+ years of professional experience.

**Purpose of Coming to New Zealand**

My primary purpose is to maintain our family unity while my wife pursues her studies in New Zealand. We have been married for over 10 years and have two daughters (ages 9 and 6) who have never been separated from either parent for extended periods. As my wife will be studying full-time, it is essential for me to be present to provide childcare support and maintain our family stability.

Our decision to relocate temporarily as a family ensures our children's emotional wellbeing and allows me to support my wife's academic goals while she transitions back into full-time IT professional work after her career break for child-rearing.

**Professional Background and Work Plans**

I am currently employed as a Senior Software Development Manager at NETe2 Asia Pte Ltd, Singapore, where I have worked for 15 years. I lead development teams and manage software projects for enterprise clients, with expertise in cloud architecture, video management systems, and team leadership.

During our stay in New Zealand, I intend to seek employment in the IT sector to contribute to New Zealand's technology industry while supporting our family financially. My experience in software development, team management, and enterprise solutions aligns well with New Zealand's growing tech sector needs.

**Financial Capacity**

We have established strong financial foundations to support our family during this temporary relocation. Our joint savings exceed SGD [Amount] (approximately NZD [Amount]]) accumulated from my employment income over 15 years at NETe2 Asia. We also own five plots of land in Myanmar (three under my wife's name, two under mine) demonstrating long-term financial planning.

These resources ensure we can support our family's living expenses, children's education, and my wife's study costs without financial hardship or burden on New Zealand's social services.

**Genuine Relationship and Partnership**

My relationship with Khin Khaing Zar Thein spans 17 years since we first met in May 2008. We maintained a long-distance relationship from 2010-2015 when I moved to Singapore for work, demonstrating our commitment to each other. We married on 3 April 2015 and have lived together continuously in Singapore since then.

Our relationship is supported by two children born in Singapore (2016, 2019), joint financial management through UOB bank account since 2019, continuous cohabitation across three residential addresses in Singapore, family recognition from both families in Myanmar, and supporting letters from family members including my cousin in New Zealand.

**Genuine Temporary Intentions**

I maintain substantial ties that ensure our eventual return to Singapore and Myanmar. I have a senior management position at NETe2 Asia with 15-year career progression and established professional reputation in Singapore's IT sector. Both our parents are aging and require future care in Myanmar, and we have extended family responsibilities in our hometown Taunggyi.

We own property in Myanmar representing long-term commitment and have business collaboration plans with my wife in Myanmar post-studies. Our children have strong emotional bonds with their grandparents and extended family in Myanmar who expect our return.

**Compliance with Visa Conditions**

I have maintained exemplary immigration compliance throughout my 15 years in Singapore and during international travel for business and personal purposes. I have never overstayed any visa or breached immigration conditions.

I fully understand that this visa is temporary and tied to my wife's study program duration. I commit to working only within visa conditions and permissions, maintaining lawful residence in New Zealand, departing New Zealand upon completion of my wife's studies, and adhering to all visa requirements and reporting obligations.

**Conclusion**

This application represents a genuine family decision to support my wife's educational advancement while maintaining our family unity. Our strong professional, financial, and family ties to Singapore and Myanmar ensure our return upon completion of her studies. I am committed to contributing positively to New Zealand during our temporary stay while fully complying with all visa conditions.

I respectfully request favorable consideration of my application and am available for any additional information required.

Yours sincerely,

**Zay Yar Min**
