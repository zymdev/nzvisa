**Subject:** Evidence I have been living with my partner

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to provide evidence that I have been living with my partner, Khin Khaing Zar Thein, continuously since our marriage in April 2015.

We have maintained a continuous shared household in Singapore throughout our marriage of more than 10 years. We have never had any significant periods of separation, and have lived together as a family unit since April 2015.

## Our residential history and shared household

Since our marriage, we have lived at three addresses in Singapore as our family has grown:

**April 2015:** 2A Cambridge Village, Cambridge Road, #04-07, Singapore 219679  
This was our first marital home after our marriage in April 2015. Utility bills from this period show both our names at this address.

**2016 – 2017:** 63 Tampines Avenue 1, #15-05, Singapore 529777  
We moved here when our family expanded. Utility bills from this period show both our names at this address.

**2017 – Present:** 139 Pasir Ris Street 11, #07-195, Singapore 510139  
We have been living at our current address since 2017. We have comprehensive evidence of our shared residence here including:

- **Utility bills** from 2017 to present at our current address
- **HDB resident list** exported from Singapore government website showing our family
- **UOB joint bank account** statements showing both names and current address

This evidence demonstrates continuous cohabitation for more than 10 years since our marriage, showing our genuine and stable partnership through consistent shared living arrangements at all three residential addresses.

**Yours sincerely,**

**Zay Yar Min**
