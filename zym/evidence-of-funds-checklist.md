# Evidence of Funds to Support Yourself in New Zealand (Partner of Student Work Visa)

This checklist outlines what to provide when Immigration New Zealand (INZ) asks for evidence that you can support yourself in NZ. It is tailored to your situation (partner of a student) and references evidence you already have.

---

## What INZ typically looks for
- Readily-available funds you can access while in NZ (cash/savings, not just assets)
- Recent transaction history (to verify source and availability)
- Ongoing means of support (income/employment) or a credible sponsor/guarantor
- Evidence you can meet living costs until you start working and for contingencies

---

## Benchmarks and practical targets
- Partner of Student Work Visa: Often no fixed minimum is published, but you should demonstrate sufficient savings to cover initial living costs until employment starts. A pragmatic benchmark is at least NZD 1,000 per month of intended stay (same as visitor standard) or a lump sum of NZD 5,000–10,000 for initial settlement costs.
- If relying on the student partner’s funds (your spouse): Students commonly show NZD 20,000 per year of study for living costs. Your combined funds can be considered if you have joint access.
- Return/onward travel: Either provide tickets or show additional funds to purchase them.

Note: Amounts can change. If you want, I can update these with the latest INZ figures you’re working to.

## Your situation (summary to present)
- Joint savings: > SGD 140,000 (approx. NZD ~185,000) held in Singapore bank accounts (readily available).
- Employment/income: Zay Yar Min employed as Senior Software Development Manager (SGD 7,885/month, excl. bonus).
- Financial guarantor: You are acting as your wife’s financial guarantor for study/living costs; the same funds support your initial living costs.

## Acceptable documents to include
Provide as many of the below as apply; consistency and recency are key.

1) Bank statements (6–12 months)
- For all relevant accounts (joint and personal) showing your name(s), account number(s), balance, and regular activity
- Highlight current balances and any large deposits with a short explanation (salary, savings, asset sale, etc.)

2) Bank reference/solvency letters
- Official letter(s) on bank letterhead stating account opening date, average balance, and current balance
- Include contact info for verification

3) Fixed deposits / term deposits (if any)
- Certificates showing owner’s name(s), amount, and maturity date
- Statement or letter confirming you can break the deposit early and expected settlement time

4) Employment and income evidence
- Certificate of Employment (role, salary, employment type, start date)
- Recent payslips (last 3–6 months)
- Tax Notices of Assessment (last 1–2 years)
- If continuing remote work or taking leave: employer letter stating arrangements

5) Credit facilities (optional, supplementary)
- Credit card/bank letter showing available credit limit (not a substitute for savings, but useful buffer)

6) Accommodation evidence (if prearranged)
- NZ tenancy agreement or prepaid accommodation receipts (can reduce monthly cash requirement)

7) Air tickets or proof of funds for onward travel
- E-tickets/reservations, or additional funds sufficient to purchase

## How to present the evidence
- Currency and conversions: Show balances in original currency and NZD equivalent (include exchange rate source/date).
- Name consistency: Ensure your names match passport/IDs; include marriage certificate if surnames differ.
- Translation: Translate any non-English documents; include translator’s certification.
- Recency: Bank statements and letters should be issued within the last 30–60 days.
- Accessibility: Prioritise liquid funds; property valuations alone are not accepted unless tied to accessible credit/overdraft.
- Indexing: Provide a cover sheet mapping each document to the points above (I can generate this if you share filenames).

## Suggested cover statement (you can paste into your application)
> We have readily-available joint savings exceeding SGD 140,000 (approx. NZD ~185,000), supported by 6–12 months of bank statements and a bank reference letter. I am employed as a Senior Software Development Manager in Singapore earning SGD 7,885 per month (excl. bonus), evidenced by employer letter, recent payslips, and tax notices.
