1. Introduction
Brief self-introduction (who you are, nationality, background).


State the visa you’re applying for (Partner of Student Work Visa).


Mention your relationship with your partner (the student visa holder) — when and how the relationship started, proof of genuine partnership.


State your intention: to temporarily stay in NZ with your partner while they study, and work to support your family during this period.



2. Purpose of Coming to New Zealand
Clearly explain that your primary reason is to accompany your partner who is studying in New Zealand.


Mention you plan to work legally within visa conditions (not in breach).


State that you will comply with all immigration rules and respect New Zealand’s laws.



3. Genuine Temporary Intentions
Show INZ that you plan to stay temporarily:
Mention you understand the visa is temporary and you will leave New Zealand when your partner’s study is completed.


Show evidence of ties back home (job, family, property, financial commitments, business, etc.).


If you have children, explain your family responsibilities in your home country.



4. Financial and Work Plans
Explain how you will support yourself and your partner financially.


Mention you have savings, or your partner’s tuition and living costs are already covered.


State your work intentions (not naming a specific job unless you have an offer, but explain your career background and that you’ll seek temporary legal work during your stay).



5. Compliance with Visa Conditions
State clearly:


You will only stay as long as your visa is valid.


You will leave NZ at the end of your visa.


You will follow all conditions (work only if visa allows, respect location/employer restrictions if any).



6. Evidence of Relationship
Mention that you and your partner have lived together (if applicable), and attach supporting evidence like joint lease, bills, bank accounts, photos, communication records.


Briefly summarize but let documents show the proof.



7. Travel History & Good Character
If you have traveled before, highlight your good travel record (never overstayed, always complied).


State you have never been involved in unlawful activities.



8. Conclusion
Reaffirm your genuine reason: to accompany and support your partner while she/he studies in NZ.


Acknowledge this is temporary, and you will return home after studies.


Politely request INZ to consider your application favorably.
