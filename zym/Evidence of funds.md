**Subject:** Evidence of funds to support myself in New Zealand

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to provide evidence that I have sufficient funds to support myself in New Zealand as the partner of a student. I have been employed full-time in Singapore for 15 years since 2010, and my current role is Senior Software Development Manager. I am the financial guarantor for my wife, Khin Khaing Zar Thein, whose student visa application is currently in progress.

My financial capacity is demonstrated through readily available savings held in our joint UOB bank account, exceeding SGD 140,000 (approximately NZD 185,000). These funds, which are sourced from my employment income with a gross monthly salary of SGD 7,885 (excluding bonuses), are more than sufficient to cover my living costs in New Zealand until I commence work, as well as any contingencies and the cost of onward travel.

To evidence these funds and their source, I have attached the following documents:

### Documents Attached
1. **Six months of joint UOB bank statements**
2. **A UOB bank reference letter**
3. **My Certificate of Employment, six months of payslips, and one year's tax documents**

### Explanation of Bank Transactions
For a detailed explanation of specific transactions, such as larger cash deposits and withdrawals in Marchâ€“April 2025, I have uploaded a separate document under "Other financial information" titled:
- **"Letter of explanation for bank transactions.pdf"**

I trust this information clearly demonstrates my ability to support myself during my stay in New Zealand. Thank you for your consideration of my application.


Yours sincerely,

**Zay Yar Min**
