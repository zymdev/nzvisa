Subject: Reference for Zay Yar Min and Khin Khaing Zar Thein

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to provide my full support for my cousin brother Zay Yar Min and his wife Khin Khaing Zar Thein with their partnership visa applications to New Zealand. I am currently residing in New Plymouth, New Zealand.

Zay Yar Min is my cousin (my aunt's son), and we have been very close since we were young. We have stayed together in Yangon and Singapore, and I have known him and his wife Khin Khaing Zar Thein very well. I was present at their wedding in Singapore in 2015 and when their first child was born in 2016.

From my personal observations, I can confidently confirm that Zay Yar Min and Khin Khaing Zar Thein have a genuine and stable relationship. They are devoted parents who work together as a loving family. Their marriage has been strong and committed throughout the years I have known them. I have included a photograph from their wedding dinner with family, and another photo when their first child was born, which show the close family bond we share.

I am delighted to help them settle into the New Zealand community when they arrive. Living in New Plymouth, I will be available to assist them in adapting to life here and provide ongoing support and guidance.

Thank you for considering their applications. Please feel free to contact me should you require any further information.

Sincerely,
Pyay Mon Kyaw
